# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Daydreams team takes the security of our software seriously. If you believe
you have found a security vulnerability in Daydreams, we encourage you to let us
know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to
quickly fix the problem.

## 📧 How to Report

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead,
please report them privately by emailing:

📧 **security@dreams.fun**

### What to Include

To help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue, please
include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting,
  etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue

## 🏃 Response Process

When you report a security issue, here's what happens:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate the issue
3. **Fix Development**: We'll work on a fix for confirmed vulnerabilities
4. **Coordination**: We'll coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline
5. **Release**: We'll release the fix and publish a security advisory
6. **Credit**: We'll credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain
   anonymous)

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

When using Daydreams, we recommend following these security best practices:

### API Keys and Secrets

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Rotate keys regularly**
- **Use separate keys** for development and production

### Agent Permissions

- **Limit agent permissions** to only what's necessary
- **Review agent actions** before deploying to production
- **Use read-only access** when write access isn't needed
- **Implement rate limiting** for agent actions

### Smart Contract Interactions

- **Verify contract addresses** before interacting
- **Use checksummed addresses**
- **Implement transaction limits**
- **Add confirmation steps** for high-value transactions
- **Test thoroughly** on testnets first

### Memory and Data Storage

- **Encrypt sensitive data** in memory stores
- **Implement access controls** for memory systems
- **Regular cleanup** of unnecessary data
- **Audit logs** for all data access

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Alpha Software Warning

Daydreams is currently in alpha. This means:

- The API may change without notice
- There may be undiscovered vulnerabilities
- Not recommended for production use with real funds
- Always use testnets for development

### Third-Party Dependencies

- We regularly update dependencies
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies are addressed promptly
- Use `pnpm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before deploying a Daydreams agent:

- [ ] All API keys are stored securely
- [ ] Agent permissions are minimized
- [ ] Transaction limits are implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Logging doesn't include sensitive data
- [ ] All inputs are validated
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are set up
- [ ] Recovery procedures are documented
- [ ] Code has been reviewed by another developer
