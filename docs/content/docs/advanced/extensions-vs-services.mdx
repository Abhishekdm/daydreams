title: Extensions vs Services

  Understanding the difference between extensions and services in Daydreams.
---

## Overview

The Daydreams framework uses both Services and Extensions as core architectural
components, but they serve different purposes. Let's explore the differences:

## Service (Provider)

Services are primarily focused on **Dependency Injection (DI) and Lifecycle
Management** for specific functionality, often managing external clients or
shared utilities.

- **Definition:** Created using `service({...})`
- **Key Methods:**
  - `register(container)`: Adds instances or factories to the DI container. This
    runs _before_ booting.
  - `boot(container)`: Performs asynchronous initialization after all services
    have been registered. This runs during `agent.start()`.
- **Role:** Manages _how_ a dependency is created, configured, initialized, and
  made available via the `container`.
- **Analogy:** Think of a service provider as the **blueprint and setup
  instructions** for a specific tool or utility.

## Extension

Extensions act as **modular packages or bundles** that group related Daydreams
features together for easy integration into an agent.

- **Definition:** Created using `extension({...})`
- **Contents:**
  - `name` (required): Unique identifier
  - `services`: Array of Service Provider definitions this extension requires
  - `contexts`: Definitions for specific Context types
  - `actions`: Action definitions
  - `inputs`: Input definitions
  - `outputs`: Output definitions
  - `events`: Zod schemas for events the extension might emit
  - `install(agent)`: Optional hook that runs once when the extension is added
    during `agent.start()`
- **Role:** Organizes and encapsulates a set of related functionalities and
  declares the services those functionalities need.
- **Analogy:** Think of an extension as a **toolbox** for a specific domain
  (e.g., a "Discord Toolbox").

## Key Differences

| Feature           | Service (Provider)                     | Extension                                                               |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Focus** | Dependency Injection & Lifecycle       | Bundling & Organizing Features                                          |
| **Defined By**    | `service({...})`                       | `extension({...})`                                                      |
| **Contains**      | `register`, `boot` methods             | `actions`, `contexts`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `services`, `install`, etc. |
| **Purpose**       | Manages _how_ a dependency is provided | Packages _what_ features are provided                                   |
| **Relationship**  | Often **included within** an Extension | **Uses** Services to manage its dependencies                            |

## In Simple Terms

- You define a `service` to tell the system _how_ to create and initialize
  something like an API client.
- You define an `extension` to bundle together all the `actions`, `contexts`,
  `inputs`, and `outputs` related to a feature, and you list the `services` that
  those features depend on.

When you add an `extension` to your agent via `createDreams`, the framework
automatically registers the `services` listed within that extension, making them
available via the `container` for the extension's components to use.
