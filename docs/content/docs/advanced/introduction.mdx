This section serves as an exploration of the more conceptually difficult aspects
surrounding Daydreams, as well as a collection of projects demonstrating such
niche usage.

- **[Custom Extensions](/docs/advanced/extensions):** Learn how to bundle your
  own contexts, actions, services, and more into reusable extensions.

- **[Services](/docs/advanced/services):** Understand the dependency injection
  container and service provider pattern for managing dependencies and component
  lifecycles.

- **[GRPO Training Data Export](/docs/advanced/grpo-training-export):** Discover
  how to export agent interaction data for advanced model training techniques
  like Group Relative Policy Optimization.

- **[Extensions versus Services](/docs/advanced/extensions-vs-services):** Where
  and when to use services, extensions, and why.

> ðŸ’­ **WIP**: Some sections or mentions here may be nascent explorations of the
> framework's potential.

For those truly pushing the envelope, solving the hardest problems, we want your
work to be seen. If we haven't seen you yet, the best place to find us is
Discord and X.
