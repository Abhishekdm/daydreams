title: Training Data Export for GRPO in Daydreams
description:
  This guide explains how to export episodic memories as training data for Group
  Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using the Daydreams AI core package.

## What is GRPO Training?

GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) is a reinforcement learning algorithm
designed to enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models. It
optimizes memory usage and is particularly effective for tasks requiring complex
problem-solving, such as:

- Mathematical reasoning
- Decision-making scenarios
- Step-by-step problem solving
- Game-based learning environments

**Key Benefits of GRPO:**

- Improves reasoning capabilities beyond standard fine-tuning
- Optimizes memory usage compared to traditional PPO
- Particularly effective for complex problem-solving tasks

## Workflow Overview

Your Daydreams agent can build reasoning traces for GRPO training by following
this structured workflow:

1. **Define Prompt Sources** - Use static datasets or interactive environments
2. **Generate Reasoning Traces** - Create completions that include thought
   processes
3. **Store and Save Data** - Export in JSONL format compatible with training
   tools

## Enabling Automatic Export

You can configure Daydreams to automatically export training data after each
episode:

```typescript
import { createDreams } from "@daydreamsai/core";

const agent = createDreams({
  model: openai("gpt-4-turbo"),
  exportTrainingData: true,
  trainingDataPath: "./grpo-training-data.jsonl", // Optional, defaults to "./training-data.jsonl"
  // ... other configuration options
});
```

**Note:** If you don't specify `trainingDataPath`, Daydreams will save the data
to `./training-data.jsonl` in your project root.

## Manual Export

You can manually export all episodes as training data:

```typescript
// Export using the default path from your agent configuration
await agent.exportAllTrainingData();

// Or specify a custom path
await agent.exportAllTrainingData("./custom-path/grpo-training-data.jsonl");
```

## Understanding the Data Format for GRPO

Daydreams exports training data in JSONL (JSON Lines) format, optimized for GRPO
training. Each line contains a JSON object with:

```json
{
  "prompt": "You are in a dark room with a door to the north.",
  "completion": "I need to find a way out. I should check if the door is locked.\n\nI found the door was unlocked and was able to exit the room."
}
```

The format includes:

- **prompt**: The observation or context provided to the agent
- **completion**: The agent's reasoning process and action results

For interactive environments, ensure completions include both reasoning and an
explicit action statement:

```json
{
  "prompt": "You are in a dark room with a door to the north.",
  "completion": "I need to find a way out. I should check if the door is locked.\n\nAction: try opening the door"
}
```

## Creating Custom Training Pairs for GRPO

For advanced use cases, you can create custom training data pairs specifically
designed for GRPO:

## Optimizing Data for GRPO Training

To maximize the effectiveness of your GRPO training data:

1. **Include diverse scenarios** - Ensure your agent encounters a variety of
   situations
2. **Capture step-by-step reasoning** - The completion should show the agent's
   thought process
3. **Format actions consistently** - Use patterns like "Action: [action]" for
   easy parsing
4. **Balance task difficulty** - Include both simple and complex reasoning
   challenges

## Customizing the Export Format

If you need a different format for your specific GRPO training framework:

1. Create your own formatter function based on the Daydreams utilities
2. Process the episodic memories to match your required format
3. Save the data using your preferred file structure

**Example use case:** You might need to add additional metadata fields like task
difficulty or domain type to help with training organization.
