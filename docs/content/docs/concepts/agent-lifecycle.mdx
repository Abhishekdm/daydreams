title: Agent Lifecycle
description: How Daydreams agents process information and execute tasks.
---

The core of the Daydreams framework is the agent's execution lifecycle. This
loop manages how an agent receives input, reasons with an LLM, performs actions,
and handles results. Understanding this flow is crucial for building and
debugging agents.

Let's trace the lifecycle of a typical request:

## 1. Input Reception

- **Source:** An input source (like Discord, Telegram, CLI) is configured via an
  `extension`.
- **Subscription:** The `input` definition within the extension (e.g.,
  `discord:message`) uses a `subscribe` method to listen for external events.
- **Trigger:** When the external service (e.g., Discord API) emits an event
  (like a new message), the `subscribe` callback is triggered.
- **Invocation:** This callback usually invokes
  `agent.send(context, args, data)`, providing:
  - The target `context` (e.g., `discordChannelContext`).
  - `args` to identify the specific context instance (e.g.,
    `{ channelId: '...' }`).
  - The input `data` (e.g., user message content).

## 2. `agent.send`

- **Log Creation:** Creates an `InputRef` object (a type of `Log`) containing
  the input details (type, content, timestamp) and marks it as
  `processed: false`.
- **Run Initiation:** Calls `agent.run`, passing the context details and the new
  `InputRef` as part of the initial processing `chain`.

## 3. `agent.run`

- **Context Initialization:** Retrieves or creates the `ContextState` for the
  given context type and arguments. It also retrieves or creates the associated
  `WorkingMemory` for this specific run.
- **Concurrency Check:** Checks if this specific context (`ctxId`) is already
  processing in the `contextsRunning` map.
  - If yes: Pushes the new `InputRef` onto the existing run's stream handler
    (`push`) and returns the promise associated with the ongoing run.
  - If no: Proceeds to set up a new run.
- **Stream Handler Setup:** Calls `createContextStreamHandler`. This critical
  function sets up the state management for this run, including:
  - The `state` object (tracking steps, logs, actions, outputs, errors, calls,
    etc.).
  * The `handler` function that will process parsed XML tokens from the LLM's
    response stream.
  * The `push` function to add logs (`Log` objects) to the processing pipeline.
- **Tracking:** Adds the new run state to the `contextsRunning` map.
- **Start Run:** Calls `state.start()`. This prepares the initial context state
  (`prepareContext`) by loading available actions, outputs, etc., and creates
  the first `StepRef` log.
- **Step Loop:** Enters the main processing loop
  (`while ((maxSteps = getMaxSteps()) >= state.step)`), which iterates through
  reasoning steps.

## 4. Inside the Step Loop

Each iteration represents one turn of the agent's reasoning cycle:

- **Prepare State:** Calls `prepareContext` again (or `state.nextStep()` which
  internally calls `prepare`). This refreshes the available actions, outputs,
  and context data based on the _current_ `WorkingMemory`, including results
  from the previous step.
- **Prompt Generation:**
  - `formatPromptSections` gathers the prepared actions, outputs, context
    states, and `WorkingMemory` logs (both processed and unprocessed).
  - Various `format*` functions convert these objects into standardized XML
    strings using the `xml` helper and `formatXml`.
  - `render` injects these XML strings into the main `promptTemplate`.
- **LLM Call:**
  - The `runGenerate` task is enqueued via the `taskRunner`.
  - It sends the fully formatted XML prompt to the configured LLM.
  - It returns a text stream (`stream`) of the LLM's response and a promise for
    the complete text (`getTextResponse`).
- **Stream Processing:**
  - `handleStream` consumes the LLM's text stream.
  - It uses `xmlStreamParser` to parse the incoming text into XML tokens
    (`StartTag`, `EndTag`, `TextContent`) based on recognized tags.
  - `handleStream` reconstructs logical `StackElement` objects from these
    tokens.
  - For each `StackElement`, the `handler` function (created by
    `createContextStreamHandler`) is invoked.
- **Handling Parsed Elements:**
  - This `handler` uses `getOrCreateRef` to create or update partial `Log`
    entries (like `Thought`, `ActionCall`, `OutputRef`) based on the incoming
    `StackElement` data.
  - When an element is fully parsed (`el.done` is true), it calls
    `handlePushLog`.
- **Processing Completed Logs:**
  - This is the core logic reacting to the LLM's parsed output. Based on the
    `Log` object's `ref` type:
    - `thought`: Logs the reasoning step, calls the `onThinking` handler if
      provided.
    - `input`: Calls `handleInput` for schema validation, custom processing, and
      potential episodic memory query.
    - `output`: Calls `handleOutputStream` -> `handleOutput`. Validates against
      schema, runs the output's `handler`, formats result, adds `OutputRef` to
      memory.
    - `action_call`: Calls `handleActionCallStream` -> `prepareActionCall` to
      parse args and resolve templates. Pushes execution logic
      (`handleActionCall` -> `runAction` task) onto `state.calls`. The
      `ActionResult` is added back via `handlePushLog`.
    - `action_result`: Logs the result. Optionally calls `generateEpisode`.
  - Notifies subscribers (`onLogStream`).
  - Saves the updated `WorkingMemory`.
- **Action Synchronization:** After the LLM response stream is fully processed,
  `agent.run` waits for all action promises in `state.calls` to settle.
- **Loop Continuation:** Checks `state.shouldContinue()`. If yes, increments
  `state.step` and loops.

## 5. Run Completion

- **Exit Loop:** Once the loop condition is met, the loop exits.
- **Cleanup:** Marks any remaining logs as processed.
- **Hooks:** Calls `onRun` hooks defined in the active contexts.
- **Save State:** Saves the final state of all involved contexts.
- **Release:** Removes the run (`ctxId`) from the `contextsRunning` map.
- **Return:** Resolves the original promise returned by `agent.run` with the
  complete array of `Log` objects generated during the run (`state.chain`).

This detailed cycle illustrates how Daydreams agents iteratively perceive
(inputs, results), reason (LLM prompt/response), and act (outputs, actions),
using streaming and asynchronous processing to handle complex interactions
efficiently.
