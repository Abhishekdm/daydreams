  Understand the fundamental building blocks of the Daydreams framework.

The Daydreams framework is designed around a set of core concepts that work
together to enable autonomous agent behavior. Understanding these concepts is
key to effectively building and customizing agents.

## Core Architecture

A Daydreams agent consists of several key components:

### Contexts

Contexts are the foundation of a Daydreams agent. Similar to React components,
contexts manage state and rendering for your agent. Each context:

- Has a defined schema for initialization
- Maintains its own memory state
- Provides a rendering function that formats its state for the LLM

```ts
const myContext = context({
  // Unique identifier for this context type
  type: "my-context",

  // Schema defining the arguments needed to initialize this context
  schema: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
  }),

  // Function to generate a unique key for this context instance
  key({ id }) {
    return id;
  },

  // Initialize the context's memory state
  create(state) {
    return {
      items: [],
      currentItem: null,
    };
  },

  // Format the context for the LLM
  render({ memory }) {
    return `
      Current Items: ${memory.items.join(", ")}
      Active Item: ${memory.currentItem || "None"}
    `;
  },
});
```

### Actions

Actions are functions that your agent can call to interact with its environment
or modify its state. They're similar to event handlers in React:

```ts
action({
  name: "addItem",
  description: "Add a new item to the list",
  schema: z.object({
    item: z.string().describe("The item to add"),
  }),
  handler(call, ctx, agent) {
    // Access the context memory
    const contextMemory = ctx.agentMemory;

    // Update the state
    contextMemory.items.push(call.data.item);

    // Return a response
    return {
      message: `Added ${call.data.item} to the list`,
      items: contextMemory.items,
    };
  },
});
```

### Extensions

Extensions are pre-packaged bundles of inputs, outputs, and actions that add
specific capabilities to your agent. For example, the `cli` extension adds
terminal input/output capabilities.

## The React-like Mental Model

If you're familiar with React, you can think of Daydreams in similar terms:

- **Contexts** are like React components, managing state and rendering
- **Actions** are like event handlers, responding to inputs and updating state
- **Extensions** are like pre-built component libraries
- The agent itself is like a React application, orchestrating everything

This mental model makes it easy to reason about how your agent works and how to
structure complex behaviors.

This section provides a detailed explanation of each fundamental component:

- **[Agent Lifecycle](/docs/concepts/agent-lifecycle):** How an agent processes
  information, makes decisions, and executes tasks in a continuous loop.
- **[Contexts](/docs/concepts/contexts):** The mechanism for managing state,
  memory, and behavior for specific tasks or interactions.
- **[Actions](/docs/concepts/actions):** Definable tasks or capabilities that an
  agent can perform.
- **[Inputs](/docs/concepts/inputs):** How agents receive data and trigger
  processing cycles.
- **[Outputs](/docs/concepts/outputs):** How agents communicate results or send
  information to external systems.
- **[Memory](/docs/concepts/memory):** The different ways agents store,
  retrieve, and utilize information (Working, Episodic, Vector).
- **[Prompting](/docs/concepts/prompting):** How instructions and context are
  formatted for the LLM to guide its reasoning.
- **[Tasks](/docs/concepts/tasks):** The system for managing asynchronous
  operations and background tasks.
- **[Services & Extensions](/docs/advanced):** How to integrate external
  services and extend the framework's capabilities.
