  Understand the fundamental building blocks of the Daydreams framework.
---

The Daydreams framework is designed around a set of core concepts that work
together to enable autonomous agent behavior. Understanding these concepts is
key to effectively building and customizing agents.

This section provides a detailed explanation of each fundamental component:

- **[Agent Lifecycle](/docs/concepts/agent-lifecycle):** How an agent processes
  information, makes decisions, and executes tasks in a continuous loop.
- **[Contexts](/docs/concepts/contexts):** The mechanism for managing state,
  memory, and behavior for specific tasks or interactions.
- **[Actions](/docs/concepts/actions):** Definable tasks or capabilities that an
  agent can perform.
- **[Inputs](/docs/concepts/inputs):** How agents receive data and trigger
  processing cycles.
- **[Outputs](/docs/concepts/outputs):** How agents communicate results or send
  information to external systems.
- **[Memory](/docs/concepts/memory):** The different ways agents store,
  retrieve, and utilize information (Working, Episodic, Vector).
- **[Prompting](/docs/concepts/prompting):** How instructions and context are
  formatted for the LLM to guide its reasoning.
- **[Streaming & Parsing](/docs/concepts/streaming-parsing):** How the framework
  handles and interprets the LLM's output stream in real-time.
- **[Task Runner](/docs/concepts/task-runner):** The system for managing
  asynchronous operations and background tasks.
- **[Services & Extensions](/docs/concepts/services-extensions):** How to
  integrate external services and extend the framework's capabilities.

the hood.
