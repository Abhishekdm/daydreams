  Understand the fundamental building blocks of the Daydreams framework.
---

The Daydreams framework is designed around a set of core concepts that work
together to enable autonomous agent behavior. Understanding these concepts is
key to effectively building and customizing agents.

This section provides a detailed explanation of each fundamental component:

- **[Agent Lifecycle](./agent-lifecycle):** How an agent processes information,
  makes decisions, and executes tasks in a continuous loop.
- **[Contexts](./contexts):** The mechanism for managing state, memory, and
  behavior for specific tasks or interactions.
- **[Actions](./actions):** Definable tasks or capabilities that an agent can
  perform.
- **[Inputs](./inputs):** How agents receive data and trigger processing cycles.
- **[Outputs](./outputs):** How agents communicate results or send information
  to external systems.
- **[Memory](./memory):** The different ways agents store, retrieve, and utilize
  information (Working, Episodic, Vector).
- **[Prompting](./prompting):** How instructions and context are formatted for
  the LLM to guide its reasoning.
- **[Streaming & Parsing](./streaming-parsing):** How the framework handles and
  interprets the LLM's output stream in real-time.
- **[Task Runner](./task-runner):** The system for managing asynchronous
  operations and background tasks.
- **[Services & Extensions](./services-extensions):** How to integrate external
  services and extend the framework's capabilities.

the hood.
