title: Memory
description: How Daydreams agents store, recall, and learn from information.
---

Memory is fundamental to how Daydreams agents operate, allowing them to maintain
state, recall past interactions, store learned information, and improve their
performance over time. The framework provides a flexible system with different
types of memory serving distinct purposes.

## Core Memory Components (`BaseMemory`)

When creating an agent using `createDreams`, you configure its primary memory
system via the `memory` option. This accepts an object conforming to the
`BaseMemory` type, which holds implementations for different storage needs:

```typescript
import { createDreams } from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { createMemory, createMemoryStore, createVectorStore } from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { createChromaVectorStore } from "@daydreamsai/chroma"; // Example
import { createMongoMemoryStore } from "@daydreamsai/mongo"; // Example

const agent = createDreams({
  model: /* ... */,
  memory: createMemory(
    // 1. MemoryStore: For key-value based storage
    await createMongoMemoryStore({ uri: "mongodb://localhost:27017" }),

    // 2. VectorStore: For embedding storage and similarity search
    createChromaVectorStore("my-agent-episodes")
  ),
  // Optional: Enable automatic episodic memory generation
  // generateMemories: true,
  // exportTrainingData: true, // Optionally save episodes for fine-tuning
  // trainingDataPath: './agent-training.jsonl'
});
```

The `createMemory` function bundles together two main storage interfaces:

1.  **`MemoryStore`**: A key-value store interface for structured data
    persistence.
2.  **`VectorStore`**: An interface for storing vector embeddings and performing
    similarity searches, primarily used for episodic memory.

The `BaseMemory` object passed to `createDreams` makes these stores available
throughout the agent's systems.

## `MemoryStore` (Key-Value Storage)

The `MemoryStore` handles the persistence of structured data associated with
contexts and actions. It defines a simple key-value interface:

- `get<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null>`: Retrieve data by key.
- `set<T>(key: string, value: T): Promise<void>`: Store or update data by key.
- `delete(key: string): Promise<void>`: Remove data by key.
- `clear(): Promise<void>`: Remove all data (use with caution).

**Uses:**

- Storing `ContextState` snapshots (key: `"context:<contextId>"`).
- Storing persistent `Context` memory (key: `"memory:<contextId>"`).
- Storing `WorkingMemory` snapshots between runs (key:
  `"working-memory:<contextId>"`).
- Storing persistent `Action` memory (key: defined in `action.memory.key`).

**Implementations:**

- `createMemoryStore()`: Default in-memory store using a `Map` (data lost on
  restart). Found in `@daydreamsai/core`.
- `createMongoMemoryStore()`: MongoDB-backed implementation. Found in
  `@daydreamsai/mongo`.
- _(Others like SQLite, Redis might be available or could be implemented)_

## `VectorStore` (Embedding Storage & Search)

The `VectorStore` is designed for handling high-dimensional vector embeddings,
typically used for semantic search and retrieving relevant past experiences
(Episodic Memory).

- `upsert(contextId: string, data: any): Promise<void>`: Add or update vector
  embeddings, often associated with a specific context.
- `query(contextId: string, query: string): Promise<any[]>`: Search for vectors
  similar to the query text within a specific context.
- `createIndex(indexName: string): Promise<void>`: Create an index (if required
  by the backend).
- `deleteIndex(indexName: string): Promise<void>`: Delete an index.

**Uses:**

- Storing `Episode` embeddings for recall.
- Potentially storing document embeddings for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation) patterns (though not explicitly shown in the core loop).

**Implementations:**

- `createVectorStore()`: Default no-op implementation (does nothing). Found in
  `@daydreamsai/core`.
- `createChromaVectorStore()`: Implementation using ChromaDB. Found in
  `@daydreamsai/chroma`. Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` for default embedding or a
  custom embedder.
- _(Others like Pinecone might be available or could be implemented)_

## Clarification: Context vs. Memory

It's important to distinguish between the concept of a "Context" and "Memory":

- **Context (`context({...})` Definition & `ContextState` Instance):**

  - **Definition:** Think of this as a **blueprint** or template for a specific
    type of interaction scope (e.g., a chat session, a game state). It defines
    the _rules_, _behavior_, expected `schema` arguments, the structure of its
    persistent memory (`create`), how that state is rendered for the LLM
    (`render`), and its associated `inputs`, `outputs`, and `actions`.
  - **Instance (`ContextState`):** This is a **runtime instance** of a Context
    definition, representing a specific, active scope (e.g., the chat session
    with _user A_). It holds a reference to the definition, the specific `args`
    used to identify it, and the actual, current **memory payload** for this
    instance (`ContextState.memory`).

- **Memory (`ContextState.memory`, `WorkingMemory`, etc.):**
  - **Context Memory (`ContextState.memory`):** This is the actual **persistent
    data payload** or state associated with a specific `ContextState` instance.
    Its structure is determined by the `context.create` function. This is what's
    loaded from/saved to the `MemoryStore` and rendered via `context.render`.
  - **Other Memory Types:** The framework also uses other memory concepts like
    `WorkingMemory` (transient log for a single run), `ActionMemory` (persistent
    state for an action definition), and `AgentMemory` (persistent state for the
    main agent context). These are distinct from the specific
    `ContextState.memory` of a running context instance.

**In essence:**

A **Context** defines the **structure and behavior** of an interaction scope.
**Memory** (specifically `ContextState.memory`) is the **persistent data**
stored _within_ a particular instance of that Context.

## Types of Memory Usage

### Working Memory

- **Purpose:** Short-term, temporary storage for a single `agent.run` cycle.
- **Content:** Holds the sequence of `Log` objects (`InputRef`, `OutputRef`,
  `Thought`, `ActionCall`, `ActionResult`, `EventRef`, `StepRef`, `RunRef`)
  generated during the run.
- **Lifecycle:** Created at the start of `agent.run`, populated during stream
  processing, used to build prompts at each step, and potentially snapshotted to
  the `MemoryStore` between runs.
- **Access:** Available as `ctx.workingMemory` within handlers.

### Context Memory

- **Purpose:** Persistent state associated with a specific `Context` instance
  (e.g., chat history for a specific user session).
- **Structure:** Defined by the `create` function in the `context` definition.
- **Lifecycle:** Loaded from the `MemoryStore` when `agent.getContext` is
  called, updated by context logic or actions, saved back to the `MemoryStore`
  via `agent.saveContext`.
- **Access:** Available as `ctx.memory` within context-related functions
  (`render`, `onStep`, etc.) and action handlers.

### Action Memory

- **Purpose:** Persistent state associated specifically with an `Action`
  definition, allowing it to maintain state across multiple calls within
  different runs or contexts.
- **Structure:** Defined by the `memory` option in the `action` definition,
  using the `memory()` helper.
- **Lifecycle:** Loaded from the `MemoryStore` before the action handler runs,
  potentially updated by the handler, saved back to the `MemoryStore` after the
  handler completes.
- **Access:** Available as `ctx.actionMemory` within the action's handler.

### Agent Memory

- **Purpose:** Persistent state associated with the agent's main/root context
  (if one is defined in `createDreams`). Used for global agent state.
- **Lifecycle:** Loaded/saved from the `MemoryStore` using the main agent
  context's ID.
- **Access:** Available as `ctx.agentMemory` within action handlers when a main
  agent context exists.

### Episodic Memory

- **Purpose:** Enables the agent to learn from past experiences by recalling
  relevant "episodes" (sequences of observation/thought -> action -> result).
- **Structure:** Defined by the `Episode` interface (observation, thoughts,
  result, timestamp, etc.).
- **Generation:** Handled by `generateEpisode` (`memory/utils.ts`), which uses
  an LLM to summarize the `Thought`, `ActionCall`, and `ActionResult`. Triggered
  automatically if `agent.memory.generateMemories` is true.
- **Storage:** The generated `Episode` (or its embedding) is stored in the
  `VectorStore` via `agent.memory.vector.upsert()`.
- **Retrieval:** When a new `InputRef` is processed (`handleInput`), the
  `agent.memory.vector.query()` method is called to find relevant past episodes
  based on the input content. Retrieved episodes are added to
  `WorkingMemory.episodicMemory`.
- **Training Data:** Episodes can be exported as prompt/completion pairs for
  fine-tuning models using `agent.exportAllTrainingData()` or by setting
  `exportTrainingData: true` on the agent config.

By combining these memory types and storage backends, Daydreams agents can
maintain short-term focus (Working Memory), long-term context state
(Context/Action/Agent Memory), and learn from past interactions (Episodic Memory
via VectorStore).
