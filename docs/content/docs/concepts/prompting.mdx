  How Daydreams structures prompts to guide LLM reasoning and actions.
---

The interaction between the Daydreams framework and the Large Language Model
(LLM) is mediated through carefully structured prompts. These prompts provide
the LLM with the necessary context, instructions, available tools (actions and
outputs), and current state, guiding its reasoning process and constraining its
output format.

## The Main Prompt Template (`mainPrompt`)

The core prompt structure is defined in `packages/core/src/prompts/main.ts`
within the `mainPrompt` configuration object. It uses a main template string
(`promptTemplate`) composed of several sections identified by placeholders:

```text
{{intro}}      # General instructions for the agent's task
{{instructions}} # Step-by-step guide on how to process updates
{{content}}    # Dynamically generated section with available tools and state
{{response}}   # Structure definition for the LLM's expected output
{{footer}}     # Final reminders and important notes
```

Each placeholder (`{{intro}}`, `{{instructions}}`, etc.) corresponds to static
text providing overall guidance to the LLM on how it should behave within the
framework.

## Dynamic Prompt Generation

At each step of the [Agent Lifecycle](/docs/concepts/agent-lifecycle), the
framework dynamically generates the content for the `{{content}}` section of the
`promptTemplate`. This ensures the LLM always has the most up-to-date
information.

1.  **Gathering Data (`formatPromptSections`)**: The `formatPromptSections`
    function (in `packages/core/src/prompts/main.ts`) collects the current
    state, including:
    - Available `actions`.
    - Available `outputs`.
    - Active `contexts` and their rendered state.
    - Recent `WorkingMemory` logs (both processed and unprocessed).
2.  **Formatting to XML (`packages/core/src/formatters.ts`)**: Various helper
    functions (`formatAction`, `formatContextState`, `formatOutputInterface`,
    `formatContextLog`, `formatValue`, `formatXml`) convert these JavaScript
    objects and data structures into standardized XML strings. This XML format
    is designed to be clearly parsable by both the LLM and the framework's
    stream parser.
3.  **Rendering (`render`)**: The `render` function (from
    `packages/core/src/formatters.ts`) injects these dynamically generated XML
    strings into the main `promptTemplate`, replacing placeholders like
    `{{actions}}`, `{{outputs}}`, `{{contexts}}`, `{{workingMemory}}`, and
    `{{updates}}`.

## Key XML Sections in the Prompt

The dynamically generated `{{content}}` section typically includes these crucial
XML blocks:

- **`<available-actions>`**: Lists all actions currently enabled for the agent.
  Each action includes its `name`, `description`, `instructions`, and argument
  `schema` (as JSON schema).
  ```xml
  <available-actions>
    <action name="getWeather">
      <description>Fetches the current weather...</description>
      <schema>{ "type": "object", "properties": { ... } }</schema>
    </action>
    ...
  </available-actions>
  ```
- **`<available-outputs>`**: Lists all outputs the agent can generate. Each
  output includes its `type`, `description`, `instructions`, content `schema`
  (`content_schema`), attribute `schema` (`attributes_schema`), and `examples`.
  ```xml
  <available-outputs>
    <output type="discord:message">
      <description>Sends a message...</description>
      <attributes_schema>{ "type": "object", ... }</attributes_schema>
      <content_schema>{ "type": "string", ... }</content_schema>
      <examples>...</examples>
    </output>
    ...
  </available-outputs>
  ```
- **`<contexts>`**: Displays the state of currently active contexts, as rendered
  by their respective `render` functions.
  ```xml
  <contexts>
    <context type="chat" key="session123">
      user1: Hi there!
      agent: Hello! How can I help?
    </context>
    ...
  </contexts>
  ```
- **`<working-memory>`**: Shows _processed_ logs (`InputRef`, `OutputRef`,
  `ActionCall`, `ActionResult`, `Thought`, `EventRef`) from previous steps
  within the _current_ run.
  ```xml
  <working-memory>
    <input type="cli:message" timestamp="...">User message</input>
    <action_call name="lookupUser" id="..." timestamp="...">...</action_call>
    <action_result callId="..." name="lookupUser" timestamp="...">...</action_result>
    <output type="cli:message" timestamp="...">Agent response</output>
  </working-memory>
  ```
- **`<updates>`**: Shows _new_, _unprocessed_ logs (typically new `InputRef`s or
  `ActionResult`s from the previous step) that the LLM needs to analyze and
  react to in the _current_ step.
  ```xml
  <updates>
    <input type="discord:message" timestamp="...">A new message requiring a response</input>
    <action_result callId="..." name="complexCalculation" timestamp="...">Result is 42</action_result>
  </updates>
  ```

## Expected LLM Response Structure

The framework instructs the LLM (via the `{{response}}` section of the template)
to structure its output using specific XML tags:

```xml
<response>
  <reasoning>
    [LLM's thought process explaining its analysis and plan]
  </reasoning>

  [Optional: Action calls]
  <action_call name="actionName">[Arguments based on action schema and format (JSON/XML)]</action_call>

  [Optional: Outputs]
  <output type="outputType" attribute1="value1">[Content matching the output's schema]</output>
</response>
```

- **`<response>`**: The root tag for the entire response.
- **`<reasoning>`**: Contains the LLM's step-by-step thinking process. This is
  logged as a `Thought`.
- **`<action_call>`**: Used to invoke an action. The `name` must match an
  available action. The content (arguments) depends on the action's defined
  `schema` and `callFormat` (defaulting to JSON if schema is complex, but can be
  XML). The framework parses this content accordingly.
- **`<output>`**: Used to generate an output. The `type` must match an available
  output. Any required `attributes` must be included, and the content must match
  the output's content `schema`.

The framework parses this XML structure from the LLM's response stream to
trigger the corresponding handlers for actions and outputs.

## Template Engine (`{{...}}`)

The prompt template includes a mention of a simple template engine using
`{{...}}` syntax (e.g., `{{calls[0].someValue}}`, `{{shortTermMemory.key}}`). As
noted in the prompt comments, its primary intended use is for **intra-turn data
referencing**. This means allowing an action call within the _same_ LLM response
to reference the anticipated result of a _previous_ action call in that _same_
response.

Example:

```xml
<response>
  <reasoning>First, I need to create a file, then write to it.</reasoning>
  <action_call name="createFile">{ "directory": "/tmp" }</action_call>
  <action_call name="writeFile">{ "fileId": "{{calls[0].fileId}}", "content": "Hello!" }</action_call>
</response>
```

Here, the `writeFile` call references the `fileId` expected to be returned by
the `createFile` action called just before it within the same LLM response turn.
The framework resolves these templates _before_ executing the action handlers
(using `resolveTemplates` in `packages/core/src/handlers.ts`).

This dynamic and structured prompting approach allows Daydreams to effectively
leverage LLMs for complex orchestration tasks, providing them with the necessary
information and tools while ensuring their output can be reliably processed.
