  Understanding dependency injection, service providers, and modular extensions.
---

Daydreams uses a combination of Dependency Injection (DI), Service Providers,
and an Extension system to manage dependencies, initialize components, and
organize functionality in a modular way.

## Dependency Injection (`container.ts`)

At the heart of the framework's modularity is a simple Dependency Injection
container, created using `createContainer()`. The container is responsible for
instantiating and providing access to various services and components throughout
the agent's lifecycle.

**Purpose:**

- Decouples components by removing the need for them to know how to create their
  dependencies.
- Manages the lifecycle of services (e.g., ensuring only one instance of a
  database client exists).
- Makes components like loggers, clients, or configuration easily accessible.

**Core Methods:**

- `container.register(token, factory)`: Registers a factory function. A _new
  instance_ is created every time `resolve` is called for the `token`.
- `container.singleton(token, factory)`: Registers a factory function, but the
  instance is created _only once_ on the first `resolve` call. Subsequent calls
  return the same instance.
- `container.instance(token, value)`: Registers a pre-existing object instance
  directly.
- `container.resolve<Type>(token)`: Retrieves the instance associated with the
  `token`. Throws an error if the token is not registered.
- `container.alias(aliasToken, originalToken)`: Creates an alternative name
  (`aliasToken`) to resolve an existing `originalToken`.

```typescript
import { createContainer } from "@daydreamsai/core";

const container = createContainer();

// Register a singleton database client
container.singleton("dbClient", () => new DatabaseClient(process.env.DB_URI));

// Register a pre-created config object
const config = { apiKey: "123" };
container.instance("appConfig", config);

// Register a transient logger (new instance each time)
container.register(
  "requestLogger",
  () => new Logger({ level: LogLevel.DEBUG })
);

// Resolve dependencies
const db = container.resolve<DatabaseClient>("dbClient");
const cfg = container.resolve<typeof config>("appConfig");
const logger1 = container.resolve<Logger>("requestLogger");
const logger2 = container.resolve<Logger>("requestLogger"); // Different instance from logger1
```

The main `Agent` instance, `Logger`, `TaskRunner`, and other core components are
typically registered within the container when `createDreams` is called.

## Service Providers (`serviceProvider.ts`)

While you could register everything directly with the container, Daydreams uses
a Service Provider pattern to organize the registration and initialization
(booting) of related services, especially within extensions.

**Purpose:**

- Groups related service registrations.
- Provides a dedicated `boot` phase for initialization logic that might depend
  on other services already being registered (e.g., connecting a client after
  its configuration is registered).

**Defining a Service Provider:**

Use the `service` helper function:

```typescript
import { service, type Container } from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { MyApiClient } from "./my-api-client";

const myApiService = service({
  // Optional: Register dependencies into the container.
  // Runs before the boot phase.
  register(container: Container) {
    container.singleton("apiConfig", () => ({ baseUrl: process.env.API_URL }));
    container.singleton(
      "apiClient",
      (c) => new MyApiClient(c.resolve("apiConfig"))
    );
  },

  // Optional: Perform initialization logic after registration.
  // Runs during agent.start() after all services are registered.
  async boot(container: Container) {
    const apiClient = container.resolve<MyApiClient>("apiClient");
    await apiClient.connect(); // Example: Connect the client
    console.log("My API Client Connected!");
  },
});
```

**Lifecycle:**

1.  **Registration:** When a service provider is added to the agent (usually via
    an extension), its `register` method is called immediately by the
    `ServiceManager` (created internally in `createDreams`).
2.  **Booting:** When `agent.start()` is called, the `ServiceManager` iterates
    through all registered service providers and calls their `boot` methods
    _after_ all `register` methods have completed.

## Extensions (`extension()` helper)

Extensions are the primary mechanism for packaging and distributing reusable
Daydreams functionality. They bundle together contexts, actions, inputs,
outputs, and service providers.

**Purpose:**

- Encapsulate features (e.g., Discord integration, ChromaDB support).
- Simplify agent configuration by adding features with a single entry.
- Promote code reuse.

**Defining an Extension:**

Use the `extension` helper function:

```typescript
import {
  extension,
  context,
  action,
  input,
  output,
  service,
} from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { z } from "zod";
import { MyApiClient } from "./my-api-client"; // From previous example

// Assume myApiService is defined as above

const myFeatureContext = context({
  /* ... context definition ... */
});
const myFeatureAction = action({
  /* ... action definition ... */
});

export const myExtension = extension({
  // Required: A unique name for the extension
  name: "my-feature",

  // Optional: Service providers required by this extension
  services: [myApiService],

  // Optional: Context definitions provided by this extension
  contexts: {
    myFeature: myFeatureContext,
  },

  // Optional: Action definitions
  actions: [myFeatureAction],

  // Optional: Input definitions
  inputs: {
    "my-feature:event": input({
      /* ... input definition ... */
    }),
  },

  // Optional: Output definitions
  outputs: {
    "my-feature:notify": output({
      /* ... output definition ... */
    }),
  },

  // Optional: Events defined by this extension (used for typing ctx.emit)
  events: {
    myEvent: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
  },

  // Optional: Logic to run once when the extension is added during agent.start()
  async install(agent) {
    console.log("Installing My Feature Extension!");
    // Perform any one-time setup
  },
});
```

**Usage and Lifecycle:**

1.  **Configuration:** Pass extensions to `createDreams` in the `extensions`
    array:

    ```typescript
    import { createDreams } from "@daydreamsai/core";
    import { myExtension } from "./my-extension";
    import { discord } from "@daydreamsai/discord"; // Example built-in

    const agent = createDreams({
      model: /* ... */,
      extensions: [
        myExtension,
        discord, // Add other extensions
      ]
    });
    ```

2.  **Merging:** When `createDreams` initializes, it merges all components
    (`contexts`, `actions`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `events`) defined within the
    extensions into the agent's main registry.
3.  **Service Registration:** It registers all `services` defined in the
    extensions with the `ServiceManager`.
4.  **Installation & Booting:** When `agent.start()` is called:
    - The `install` method of each extension is executed (if defined).
    - The `ServiceManager` boots all registered services (calling their `boot`
      methods).

Extensions provide a powerful way to structure agent capabilities, making it
easy to combine built-in features (like CLI, Discord, Chroma) with custom logic.
