title: Streaming & Parsing
description: How Daydreams processes LLM response streams in real-time.
---

Large Language Models (LLMs) generate responses token by token. To enable
responsive and interactive agents, Daydreams processes this output _as it
arrives_ (streaming) and parses the structured information (like action calls or
outputs) embedded within the stream. The framework relies on an XML-based
structure in the LLM's response for reliable parsing.

## Expected LLM Response Format

As detailed in the [Prompting](./prompting#expected-llm-response-structure)
section, the framework expects the LLM to wrap its response in a `<response>`
tag and use specific child tags like `<reasoning>`, `<action_call>`, and
`<output>`.

```xml
<response>
  <reasoning>...</reasoning>
  <action_call name="...">...</action_call>
  <output type="...">...</output>
</response>
```

## The Parsing Pipeline

The processing of the LLM's raw text stream involves several components working
together:

1.  **LLM Stream:** The raw `AsyncIterable<string>` coming from the LLM provider
    (e.g., via `streamText` from the AI SDK).
2.  **`xmlStreamParser` (`xml.ts`):** This generator function is the low-level
    parser.
    - **Input:** Consumes chunks of text from the LLM stream.
    - **Logic:** It looks for potential XML tag boundaries (`<`, `>`). Based on
      a provided set of `parseTags` (e.g.,
      `{"reasoning", "action_call", "output"}`) and a `shouldParse` function
      (which determines if a specific tag occurrence should be treated as
      structure or just text), it identifies the start and end of relevant XML
      elements.
    - **Output:** Yields `XMLToken` objects:
      - `{ type: "start", name: "...", attributes: {...} }`
      - `{ type: "end", name: "..." }`
      - `{ type: "text", content: "..." }`
3.  **`handleStream` (`streaming.ts`):** This function orchestrates the parsing.
    - **Input:** Takes the LLM stream, the set of `parseTags`, the `shouldParse`
      function, and a `handler` callback.
    - **Logic:** It iterates through the `XMLToken`s yielded by
      `xmlStreamParser`. It maintains a stack to handle nested elements and
      reconstructs logical `StackElement` objects. A `StackElement` represents a
      parsed XML tag, accumulating its `content` as text tokens arrive between
      the start and end tokens.
    - **Output:** Calls the provided `handler` callback whenever a
      `StackElement` is created or its content is updated, and importantly, when
      it's considered complete (`done: true` - when the corresponding end tag is
      parsed).
4.  **`createContextStreamHandler` (`streaming.ts`):** This function, called
    during `agent.run`, sets up the run-specific state and provides the actual
    `handler` callback function to `handleStream`.
    - **The `handler` Callback:** This function bridges the parsed elements to
      the framework's log objects.
      - It uses `getOrCreateRef` to associate each `StackElement` (identified by
        its index in the stream) with a specific `Log` object (`Thought`,
        `ActionCall`, `OutputRef`).
      - As text content arrives for a `StackElement`, it updates the `content`
        of the corresponding `Log` object.
      - When `handleStream` signals that a `StackElement` is complete
        (`el.done`), this handler calls `handlePushLog`.
5.  **`handlePushLog` (`streaming.ts`):** This function acts on the completed
    `Log` objects derived from the parsed stream.
    - **Input:** Receives a complete `Log` object (`Thought`, `ActionCall`,
      `OutputRef`, etc.).
    - **Logic:** Based on the `log.ref` type, it dispatches the log to the
      appropriate processing function:
      - `Thought`: Logs the reasoning.
      - `ActionCall`: Triggers `handleActionCallStream` -> `handleActionCall`
        for argument parsing, template resolution, and task execution.
      - `OutputRef`: Triggers `handleOutputStream` -> `handleOutput` for schema
        validation and executing the output handler.
    - **Output:** Updates `WorkingMemory`, notifies subscribers, and potentially
      triggers further asynchronous operations (like action execution).

## Summary Flow

```
LLM Text Stream
       |
       v
xmlStreamParser (Yields XMLTokens: <start>, <text>, <end>)
       |
       v
handleStream (Reconstructs StackElements, calls handler)
       |
       v
handler (in createContextStreamHandler) (Maps StackElements to Log objects, calls handlePushLog on completion)
       |
       v
handlePushLog (Dispatches complete Log objects)
       |-------------------|-------------------|
       v                   v                   v
handleActionCall   handleOutput         (Log Thought)
(triggers task)   (sends response)       ... etc ...
```

This streaming and parsing pipeline allows Daydreams to react to the LLM's
output incrementally, enabling more interactive agent behavior and efficient
handling of structured commands like action calls and outputs, even before the
entire LLM response is finished.
