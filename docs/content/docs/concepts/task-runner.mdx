title: Task Runner
description: Managing asynchronous operations and concurrency.
---

Daydreams agents often need to perform asynchronous operations, primarily when
executing [Actions](./actions) that interact with external APIs, blockchains, or
other time-consuming processes. The framework includes a `TaskRunner` to manage
these operations efficiently.

## Purpose

The `TaskRunner` serves two main purposes:

1.  **Concurrency Control:** It limits the number of asynchronous tasks (like
    action handlers) that run simultaneously. This prevents the agent from
    overwhelming external services with too many requests at once (rate
    limiting) or consuming excessive local resources.
2.  **Prioritization (Future):** While the core framework primarily uses default
    priority, the underlying queue supports prioritizing tasks, allowing more
    critical operations to potentially execute sooner.

## Initialization and Configuration

A `TaskRunner` instance is automatically created within `createDreams` unless a
custom one is provided in the `Config`. Its concurrency limit can be configured:

```typescript
import { createDreams, TaskRunner } from "@daydreamsai/core";

// Default TaskRunner with concurrency based on environment or default (e.g., 3)
const agent1 = createDreams({
  /* ... */
});

// Explicitly configure concurrency
const agent2 = createDreams({
  // ... other config
  taskRunner: new TaskRunner(5), // Allow up to 5 tasks concurrently
});

// Access the runner later
const runner = agent2.taskRunner;
```

The concurrency limit determines how many tasks from the internal queue can be
actively running at any given moment.

## Internal Usage (`runAction`)

The most common use of the `TaskRunner` is internal to the framework. When the
agent parses an `<action_call>` from the LLM (see
[Streaming & Parsing](./streaming-parsing)), the `handleActionCall` function
doesn't execute the action's handler directly. Instead, it uses
`taskRunner.enqueueTask` to schedule the execution:

```typescript
// Simplified logic within handleActionCall (handlers.ts)

// ... prepare context and arguments ...

result.data = await taskRunner.enqueueTask(
  runAction, // The task definition for running actions
  {
    // Parameters for runAction
    action,
    agent,
    logger,
    ctx: callCtx,
  },
  {
    // Options for the task enqueueing
    debug: agent.debugger,
    retry: action.retry,
    abortSignal,
    priority: 0, // Default priority
  }
);

// ... process result ...
```

This ensures that action executions respect the concurrency limits set for the
agent.

## Defining Tasks (`task` helper)

The framework uses a `task` helper function (from `@daydreamsai/core/task`) to
define named, reusable asynchronous operations that can be managed by the
`TaskRunner`. Key framework tasks like `runAction` (executing action handlers)
and `runGenerate` (calling the LLM) are defined using this helper.

```typescript
import { task, type TaskContext } from "@daydreamsai/core";

// Example task definition (similar to runAction)
const myCustomTask = task(
  // 1. Unique key/name for the task (used for logging/debugging)
  "agent:run:myCustomTask",

  // 2. The async function implementing the task logic
  async (params: { someData: string }, ctx: TaskContext) => {
    // 'params' are the arguments passed when enqueuing
    // 'ctx' provides task-specific context

    ctx.debug("myCustomTask", ["Executing"], params); // Use debug provided via options
    console.log(`Task ${ctx.callId} running with data:`, params.someData);

    // ... perform asynchronous work ...
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));

    return { success: true, taskId: ctx.callId };
  },

  // 3. Optional default TaskOptions
  {
    retry: 1, // Default retry count
  }
);

// How it might be enqueued:
// agent.taskRunner.enqueueTask(myCustomTask, { someData: "hello" }, { priority: 1 });
```

The `TaskContext` passed to the task function includes:

- `callId`: A unique ID generated for this specific task execution.
- `debug`: A `Debugger` function instance (configured via `TaskOptions` or
  defaulting from agent config).

While you typically won't need to define new tasks often (most work happens in
action handlers), understanding this pattern helps clarify how core operations
like `runAction` are structured and managed.

## Direct Usage

While primarily used internally for actions, you _could_ access the `TaskRunner`
via `agent.taskRunner` within your custom code (e.g., inside an action handler
or context hook) if you need to manage additional complex, long-running, or
resource-intensive asynchronous operations with concurrency control. However,
simple `async/await` within action handlers is usually sufficient.

The `TaskRunner` provides robust management for the asynchronous operations
essential to the agent's functioning, ensuring stability and controlled resource
usage.
