description: Building your own modular Daydreams extensions.

Extensions are the primary mechanism for packaging and distributing reusable
Daydreams functionality. They bundle together contexts, actions, inputs,
outputs, and the service providers they depend on.

## Purpose

- **Encapsulate Features:** Group all related components for a specific
  capability (e.g., Discord integration, ChromaDB support, a custom game
  interface).
- **Simplify Agent Configuration:** Add complex features to an agent by simply
  including the extension in the `createDreams` configuration.
- **Promote Code Reuse:** Share common functionalities across different agents.

## Defining an Extension

Use the `extension` helper function exported from `@daydreamsai/core`:

```typescript
import {
  extension,
  context,
  action,
  input,
  output,
  service,
  type AnyAgent, // Import necessary types
} from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { z } from "zod";

// Assume necessary components like myApiService, myFeatureContext, etc. are defined elsewhere
declare const myApiService: any;
declare const myFeatureContext: any;
declare const myFeatureAction: any;

export const myExtension = extension({
  // Required: A unique name for the extension
  name: "my-feature",

  // Optional: Service providers required by this extension's components.
  // These services will be registered and booted automatically.
  services: [myApiService],

  // Optional: Context definitions provided by this extension.
  // These become available for use with agent.run() / agent.send().
  contexts: {
    myFeature: myFeatureContext,
  },

  // Optional: Action definitions provided by this extension.
  // These become available for the LLM to call.
  actions: [myFeatureAction],

  // Optional: Input definitions provided by this extension.
  // Their 'subscribe' methods will be called on agent.start().
  inputs: {
    "my-feature:event": input({
      /* ... input definition ... */
      subscribe: (send, agent) => {
        /* ... listen and call send() ... */
      },
    }),
  },

  // Optional: Output definitions provided by this extension.
  // These become available for the LLM to use in <output> tags.
  outputs: {
    "my-feature:notify": output({
      /* ... output definition ... */
      handler: (data, ctx, agent) => {
        /* ... send notification ... */
      },
    }),
  },

  // Optional: Events defined by this extension (primarily for typing ctx.emit).
  events: {
    myEvent: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
  },

  // Optional: Logic to run once when the extension is added during agent.start().
  // Useful for one-time setup that doesn't fit the service 'boot' lifecycle.
  async install(agent: AnyAgent) {
    console.log("Installing My Feature Extension!");
    // Example: agent.container.resolve('logger').info(...)
  },
});
```

## Usage and Lifecycle

1.  **Configuration:** Pass your extension instances to `createDreams` in the
    `extensions` array:

    ```typescript
    import { createDreams } from "@daydreamsai/core";
    import { myExtension } from "./my-extension";
    import { discord } from "@daydreamsai/discord"; // Example built-in

    const agent = createDreams({
      model: /* ... */,
      extensions: [
        myExtension,
        discord, // Add other extensions
      ],
      // ... other agent config
    });
    ```

2.  **Merging:** When `createDreams` initializes, it iterates through the
    `extensions` array. For each extension, it merges the defined `contexts`,
    `actions`, `inputs`, `outputs`, and `events` into the agent's central
    registries, making them available for use.
3.  **Service Registration:** It automatically registers all `services` listed
    within each extension with the agent's `ServiceManager`.
4.  **Installation & Booting:** When `agent.start()` is called:
    - The `install` method of each extension is executed (if defined).
    - The `ServiceManager` boots all registered services (calling their `boot`
      methods, ensuring dependencies are ready).
    - Input `subscribe` methods are called to start listening for external
      events.

Extensions provide a powerful and organized way to structure agent capabilities,
making it easy to combine built-in features with your own custom logic and
integrations.
