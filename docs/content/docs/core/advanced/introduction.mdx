## Advanced DaydreamsAI Topics

This section covers advanced concepts and internal workings of the DaydreamsAI framework. These topics are for developers who want to:

- **Understand the new memory system architecture**
- **Build custom extensions and services**
- **Integrate with specific databases and platforms**
- **Export training data for model fine-tuning**
- **Dive deep into framework internals**

## What You'll Learn

### Memory System
Learn about the completely redesigned memory architecture with providers, middleware, and multi-tier storage capabilities.

### Extensions vs Services
Understand the difference between extensions (framework additions) and services (runtime components) and when to use each.

### Platform Integrations
Deep dive into specific platform integrations like Supabase with comprehensive setup guides.

### Training Data Export
Export conversation data for fine-tuning your own models with GRPO (Generalized Reward Policy Optimization).

### Internal Architecture
Explore the framework's internals for advanced customization and debugging.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into advanced topics, make sure you're comfortable with:

- [Core Concepts](/docs/core/concepts) - Contexts, actions, memory basics
- [Building Your First Agent](/docs/core/first-agent) - Basic agent creation
- TypeScript - Advanced topics use complex types and generics
- Your chosen database/platform - MongoDB, Supabase, ChromaDB, etc.
