description: Dependency Injection & Lifecycle Management.

Daydreams utilizes a Dependency Injection (DI) container and a Service Provider
pattern to manage dependencies and component lifecycles effectively.

## Dependency Injection (`container.ts`)

At the heart of the framework's modularity is a simple Dependency Injection
container, created using `createContainer()`. The container is responsible for
instantiating and providing access to various services and components throughout
the agent's lifecycle.

**Purpose:**

- Decouples components by removing the need for them to know how to create their
  dependencies.
- Manages the lifecycle of services (e.g., ensuring only one instance of a
  database client exists).
- Makes components like loggers, clients, or configuration easily accessible.

**Core Methods:**

- `container.register(token, factory)`: Registers a factory function. A _new
  instance_ is created every time `resolve` is called for the `token`.
- `container.singleton(token, factory)`: Registers a factory function, but the
  instance is created _only once_ on the first `resolve` call. Subsequent calls
  return the same instance.
- `container.instance(token, value)`: Registers a pre-existing object instance
  directly.
- `container.resolve<Type>(token)`: Retrieves the instance associated with the
  `token`. Throws an error if the token is not registered.
- `container.alias(aliasToken, originalToken)`: Creates an alternative name
  (`aliasToken`) to resolve an existing `originalToken`.

```typescript
import { createContainer, Logger, LogLevel } from "@daydreamsai/core"; // Assuming Logger/LogLevel are exported

// Assume DatabaseClient exists
declare class DatabaseClient {
  constructor(uri: string | undefined);
}

const container = createContainer();

// Register a singleton database client
container.singleton("dbClient", () => new DatabaseClient(process.env.DB_URI));

// Register a pre-created config object
const config = { apiKey: "123" };
container.instance("appConfig", config);

// Register a transient logger (new instance each time)
container.register(
  "requestLogger",
  () => new Logger({ level: LogLevel.DEBUG })
);

// Resolve dependencies
const db = container.resolve<DatabaseClient>("dbClient");
const cfg = container.resolve<typeof config>("appConfig");
const logger1 = container.resolve<Logger>("requestLogger");
const logger2 = container.resolve<Logger>("requestLogger"); // Different instance from logger1
```

The main `Agent` instance, `Logger`, `TaskRunner`, and other core components are
typically registered within the container when `createDreams` is called.

## Service Providers (`serviceProvider.ts`)

While you could register everything directly with the container, Daydreams uses
a Service Provider pattern to organize the registration and initialization
(booting) of related services, especially within extensions.

**Purpose:**

- Groups related service registrations.
- Provides a dedicated `boot` phase for initialization logic that might depend
  on other services already being registered (e.g., connecting a client after
  its configuration is registered).

**Defining a Service Provider:**

Use the `service` helper function:

```typescript
import { service, type Container } from "@daydreamsai/core";

// Assume MyApiClient exists and has a connect method
declare class MyApiClient {
  constructor(config: { baseUrl: string | undefined });
  connect(): Promise<void>;
}

const myApiService = service({
  // Optional: Register dependencies into the container.
  // Runs before the boot phase.
  register(container: Container) {
    container.singleton("apiConfig", () => ({ baseUrl: process.env.API_URL }));
    container.singleton(
      "apiClient",
      (c) => new MyApiClient(c.resolve("apiConfig"))
    );
  },

  // Optional: Perform initialization logic after registration.
  // Runs during agent.start() after all services are registered.
  async boot(container: Container) {
    const apiClient = container.resolve<MyApiClient>("apiClient");
    await apiClient.connect(); // Example: Connect the client
    console.log("My API Client Connected!");
  },
});
```

**Lifecycle:**

1.  **Registration:** When a service provider is added to the agent (usually via
    an extension), its `register` method is called immediately by the
    `ServiceManager` (created internally in `createDreams`).
2.  **Booting:** When `agent.start()` is called, the `ServiceManager` iterates
    through all registered service providers and calls their `boot` methods
    _after_ all `register` methods have completed.

Services and the DI container form the backbone for managing dependencies and
initializing components within Daydreams agents and extensions.
