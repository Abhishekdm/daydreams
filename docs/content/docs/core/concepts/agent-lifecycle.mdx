title: Agent Lifecycle
description: How Daydreams agents process information and execute tasks.
---

The core of the Daydreams framework is the agent's execution lifecycle. This
loop manages how an agent receives input, reasons with an LLM, performs actions,
and handles results. Understanding this flow is crucial for building and
debugging agents.

Let's trace the lifecycle of a typical request:

## 1. Input Reception

- **Source:** An external system (like Discord, Telegram, CLI, or an API) sends
  information to the agent. This is usually configured via an `extension`.
- **Listener:** An `input` definition within the agent or an extension listens
  for these events (e.g., a new message arrives).
- **Trigger:** When the external event occurs, the input listener is triggered.
- **Invocation:** The listener typically calls `agent.send(...)`, providing:
  - The target `context` definition (which part of the agent should handle
    this?).
  - `args` to identify the specific context instance (e.g., which chat
    session?).
  - The input `data` itself (e.g., the message content).

## 2. `agent.send` - Starting the Process

- **Log Input:** The framework logs the incoming information as an `InputRef` (a
  record of the input).
- **Initiate Run:** It then calls the internal `agent.run` method to start or
  continue the processing cycle for the specified context instance, passing the
  new `InputRef` along.

## 3. `agent.run` - Managing the Execution Cycle

- **Load/Create Context:** The framework finds the specific `ContextState` for
  the target instance (e.g., the state for chat session #123). If it's the first
  time interacting with this instance, it creates the state and its associated
  persistent memory (`ContextState.memory`). It also retrieves or creates the
  temporary `WorkingMemory` for this specific run.
- **Handle Concurrency:** It checks if this context instance is already
  processing another request. If so, the new input is usually added to the
  ongoing run. If not, it sets up a new run.
- **Setup Run Environment:** It prepares the environment for the LLM
  interaction, gathering all available `actions`, `outputs`, and relevant
  context information.
- **Start Step Loop:** It begins the main processing loop, which iterates
  through one or more reasoning steps until the interaction is complete.

## 4. Inside the Step Loop - Perception, Reasoning, Action

Each iteration (step) within the `agent.run` loop represents one turn of the
agent's core reasoning cycle:

- **Prepare State:** The agent gathers the latest information, including:
  - The current persistent state of the active `Context`(s) (via their `render`
    functions).
  - The history of the current interaction from `WorkingMemory` (processed
    inputs, outputs, action results from previous steps).
  * Any _new_ unprocessed information (like the initial `InputRef` or results
    from actions completed in the previous step).
  * The list of currently available `actions` and `outputs`.
- **Generate Prompt:** This information is formatted into a structured prompt
  (using XML) for the LLM. The prompt clearly tells the LLM its instructions,
  what tools (actions/outputs) it has, the current state, and what new
  information needs attention. (See [Prompting](/docs/concepts/prompting)).
- **LLM Call:** The agent sends the complete prompt to the configured LLM.
- **Process LLM Response Stream:** As the LLM generates its response token by
  token:
  - The framework **streams** the response.
  - It **parses** the stream, looking for specific XML tags defined in the
    expected response structure (`<reasoning>`, `<action_call>`, `<output>`).
  - The LLM's thought process is extracted from `<reasoning>` tags and logged.
  - Instructions to perform actions (`<action_call>`) or send outputs
    (`<output>`) are identified.
- **Execute Actions & Outputs:**
  - For each identified `<action_call>`, the framework validates the arguments
    against the action's schema and schedules the action's `handler` function to
    run via the `TaskRunner`. (See [Actions](/docs/concepts/actions) and
    [Tasks](/docs/concepts/tasks)).
  * For each identified `<output>`, the framework validates the
    content/attributes and runs the output's `handler` function to send the
    information externally (e.g., post a message). (See
    [Outputs](/docs/concepts/outputs)).
- **Wait for Actions:** The agent waits for any critical asynchronous actions
  scheduled in this step to complete. Their results (`ActionResult`) are logged
  to `WorkingMemory`.
- **Check Completion:** The agent determines if the interaction is complete or
  if another reasoning step (another loop iteration) is needed based on defined
  conditions (`shouldContinue` hooks or remaining unprocessed logs).

## 5. Run Completion

- **Exit Loop:** Once the loop condition determines no further steps are needed,
  the loop exits.
- **Final Tasks:** Any final cleanup logic or `onRun` hooks defined in the
  context are executed.
- **Save State:** The final persistent state (`ContextState.memory`) of all
  involved contexts is saved to the `MemoryStore`.
- **Return Results:** The framework resolves the promise originally returned by
  `agent.send` or `agent.run`, providing the complete log (`chain`) of the
  interaction.

This detailed cycle illustrates how Daydreams agents iteratively perceive
(inputs, results), reason (LLM prompt/response), and act (outputs, actions),
using streaming and asynchronous task management to handle potentially complex
interactions efficiently.
