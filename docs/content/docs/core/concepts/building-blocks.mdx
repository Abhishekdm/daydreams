Every Daydreams agent is built from four main building blocks. Think of them as
the essential parts that work together to create intelligent behavior.

## The Four Building Blocks

### 1. Inputs - How Your Agent Listens

Inputs are how your agent receives information from the outside world.

```typescript title="input-example.ts"
// Listen for Discord messages
const discordMessage = input({
  name: "discord-message",
  description: "Receives messages from Discord",
  // When a message arrives, this triggers the agent
});
```

**Examples:**

- A Discord message arrives
- A user types in the CLI
- An API webhook gets called
- A timer goes off

### 2. Outputs - How Your Agent Speaks

Outputs are how your agent sends information back to the world.

```typescript title="output-example.ts"
// Send a Discord message
const discordReply = output({
  name: "discord-reply",
  description: "Sends a message to Discord",
  // The agent can call this to respond
});
```

**Examples:**

- Posting a message to Discord
- Printing to the console
- Sending an email
- Making an API call

### 3. Actions - What Your Agent Can Do

Actions are tasks your agent can perform to interact with systems or gather
information.

```typescript title="action-example.ts"
// Check the weather
const getWeather = action({
  name: "get-weather",
  description: "Gets current weather for a location",
  schema: z.object({
    location: z.string(),
  }),
  handler: async ({ location }) => {
    // Call weather API and return result
    return { temperature: "72°F", condition: "sunny" };
  },
});
```

**Examples:**

- Calling a weather API
- Reading from a database
- Processing a file
- Making calculations

### 4. Contexts - Your Agent's Workspace

Contexts define different "workspaces" or "modes" for your agent. Each context
has its own memory and behavior.

```typescript title="context-example.ts"
// A chat session context
const chatContext = context({
  type: "chat",
  schema: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
  }),
  // This context remembers chat history
  create: () => ({
    messages: [],
    userPreferences: {},
  }),
});
```

**Examples:**

- A chat session with a specific user
- Playing a specific game
- Processing a specific document
- Managing a specific project

## How They Work Together

Here's a simple flow showing how these building blocks connect:

1. **Input arrives** → "New Discord message from user123"
2. **Agent thinks** → "I should respond helpfully in this chat context"
3. **Agent acts** → Calls the `getWeather` action if needed
4. **Agent responds** → Uses an output to send a reply
5. **Context remembers** → Saves the conversation in chat context memory

## The React Mental Model

If you know React, think of it this way:

- **Contexts** = React components (manage state and behavior)
- **Actions** = Event handlers (respond to interactions)
- **Inputs/Outputs** = Props/callbacks (data in and out)
- **Agent** = React app (orchestrates everything)

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the building blocks, you can dive deeper into each one:

  memory
- **[Inputs](/docs/core/concepts/inputs)** - Set up ways for your agent to
  receive information
- **[Outputs](/docs/core/concepts/outputs)** - Configure how your agent responds
- **[Actions](/docs/core/concepts/actions)** - Define what your agent can do
- **[Agent Lifecycle](/docs/core/concepts/agent-lifecycle)** - Understand the
  complete execution flow
