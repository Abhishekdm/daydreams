This file provides a system called a "Dependency Injection (DI) Container",
created using `createContainer()`. Its main job is to manage shared resources or
services that different parts of your agent might need, like a connection to an
external API, a database client, or the agent's logger. It ensures these
resources are created correctly and makes them easily accessible wherever
needed.

## How to Use

You generally **don't create or directly interact** with the container yourself
using `createContainer()`. The Daydreams framework creates one automatically
when you call `createDreams`.

- **Registering:** Services (defined using the `service` helper) or Extensions
  use the container's `register`, `singleton`, or `instance` methods internally
  to tell the container _how_ to create or find a specific resource (e.g.,
  "Here's how to make the database client"). `singleton` is common for resources
  you only want one of (like a database connection).
- **Accessing:** When your `action` handler (or other component) needs to use a
  shared resource managed by the container, you access it through the `agent`
  object: `agent.container.resolve<ResourceType>('resourceName')`. For example,
  to get the logger, you might use `agent.container.resolve<Logger>('logger')`.

## Benefit

The container decouples your code. Your action handler doesn't need to know
_how_ to create the database client or logger; it just asks the container for it
by name (`'database'`, `'logger'`). This makes your code cleaner, easier to
test, and simplifies managing shared resources, especially within extensions. If
the way a resource is created changes, you only need to update its registration,
not every place it's used.

## Anticipated Questions

- _"Do I need to call `createContainer()`?"_ No, the agent created by
  `createDreams` already includes a pre-configured container available at
  `agent.container`.
- _"How do things get into the container?"_ Typically through `ServiceProvider`
  definitions (created with the `service` helper), which are often bundled
  within `Extension`s. The service's `register` method puts things into the
  container. Core framework components like the default `Logger` are also
  registered automatically.
- _"What's the difference between `register` and `singleton`?"_ When
  registering, `singleton` ensures only _one instance_ of the resource is ever
  created and shared. `register` creates a _new instance_ every time `resolve`
  is called for that name (less common for shared resources).
