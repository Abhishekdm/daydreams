title: types.ts
---

This file acts as the central dictionary for all the data structures used within
the Daydreams framework. It defines the specific "shape" (using TypeScript types
and interfaces) that different pieces of data should have, such as what
information defines an `Action`, what goes into a `Context`, or what the `Agent`
object looks like.

## How to Use

You generally **don't need to change** this file. However, you'll interact with
the types defined here frequently when writing your agent code:

- **Type Hints:** When defining the `handler` for your `action`, `input`, or
  `output`, you'll often use types imported from `@daydreamsai/core` (which
  ultimately come from this file) to get auto-completion and type safety for the
  arguments passed to your function (like the `args`, `ctx`, and `agent`
  parameters).

  ```typescript
  import {
    action,
    type ActionCallContext,
    type AnyAgent,
  } from "@daydreamsai/core";
  import { z } from "zod";

  // Define the memory structure for a specific context
  interface MyChatMemory {
    history: { role: "user" | "agent"; text: string }[];
  }

  // Use ActionCallContext with your memory type for the 'ctx' parameter
  export const myAction = action({
    name: "reply",
    schema: z.object({ message: z.string() }),
    handler: async (
      args,
      ctx: ActionCallContext<any, any, MyChatMemory>,
      agent: AnyAgent
    ) => {
      // Now, ctx.memory is correctly typed as MyChatMemory
      ctx.memory.history.push({ role: "agent", text: args.message });
      // agent parameter is typed as AnyAgent
    },
  });
  ```

- **Defining Memory:** When you define a `context`, you'll often create an
  `interface` for its specific memory structure (like `MyChatMemory` above).
  This interface defines the shape of the data stored in `ctx.memory` for that
  context.
- **Understanding Logs:** If you work with the detailed execution logs
  (`agent.run` results), the types like `InputRef`, `OutputRef`, `ActionCall`,
  `ActionResult`, `Thought` define the structure of each log entry.

## Benefit

Using the types defined here makes your code safer and easier to write. Your
code editor can provide helpful auto-completion and immediately warn you if
you're using a component incorrectly (e.g., trying to access a property that
doesn't exist on the `ctx` object or passing the wrong type of argument to an
action). It acts as a form of documentation, clarifying what data is available
where.

## Anticipated Questions

- _"Do I need to import types directly from `types.ts`?"_ No, you should import
  types directly from the main package entry point:
  `import type { Action, Context, Agent } from '@daydreamsai/core';`.
- _"There are so many types! Which ones are most important?"_ The most common
  ones you'll likely encounter when building your agent are `Agent`, `Context`,
  `Action`, `Input`, `Output`, `ActionCallContext`, `ContextState`,
  `WorkingMemory`, `MemoryStore`, `VectorStore`, and the various `Ref` types
  (`InputRef`, `OutputRef`, etc.) if you inspect execution logs. Many others are
  for internal framework use.
- _"I see types like `AnyAction`. Is it easier to use those instead of specific
  ones like `Action<MySchema, ...>`?"_ While using `AnyAction` might seem
  simpler because you don't need to specify detailed types, it's generally **not
  recommended**, especially when starting out. Using specific types gives you
  significant advantages:

  1.  **Type Safety:** TypeScript can check your code for errors _before_ you
      run it (e.g., did you misspell a property name in `ctx.memory`? Are you
      using the action's `args` correctly?). `AnyAction` turns these checks off,
      leading to potential runtime bugs that are harder to find.
  2.  **Auto-completion:** Your code editor can provide helpful suggestions for
      properties and methods when you use specific types, making coding faster
      and reducing typos. This doesn't work well with `AnyAction`.
  3.  **Clarity:** Specific types make your code easier to understand for
      yourself and others. It clearly shows what data an action expects and
      uses.

  It's better practice to define Zod schemas for action arguments and interfaces
  for context memory, then use those in your definitions (e.g.,
  `Action<typeof mySchema, MyResult, MyMemoryInterface>`).
