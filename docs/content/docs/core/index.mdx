## What is an AI Agent?

Think of an AI agent as a smart assistant that can:

- **Listen** for events (Discord messages, API calls, timers)
- **Think** about what to do (using AI models like GPT)
- **Take action** (call APIs, send responses, update databases)
- **Remember** what happened for future interactions

## Real Examples

Here are some agents you could build with Daydreams:

### Discord Weather Bot

```typescript title="weather-bot.ts"
// When someone says "what's the weather?"
// → Agent calls weather API
// → Agent responds: "It's 72°F and sunny in San Francisco"
```

### Trading Assistant

```typescript title="trading-bot.ts"
// When market conditions change
// → Agent analyzes data
// → Agent executes trades or sends alerts
```

### Customer Support Bot

```typescript title="support-bot.ts"
// When customer sends message
// → Agent checks knowledge base
// → Agent provides help or escalates to human
```
