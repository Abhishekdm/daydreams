title: context.ts
---

This file provides the essential `context` function, which you use to define
different "modes" or "workspaces" for your agent. Think of each context
definition as a blueprint for a specific task or interaction type, like handling
a chat conversation, managing a game, or performing a specific workflow. Each
active instance of a context (e.g., a specific chat session) gets its own
separate memory and state.

## How to Use

You'll typically define your contexts in separate files using the
`context({...})` function and then pass these definitions to `createDreams`. Key
things you define inside `context({...})`:

- `type`: A unique name for this type of context (e.g., `"chat"`,
  `"projectBoard"`).
- `schema`: (Using Zod) Defines the arguments needed to identify a _specific
  instance_ of this context (e.g., `{ sessionId: z.string() }` for a chat).
- `create`: A function that returns the initial structure and default values for
  this context's persistent memory (`ctx.memory`). This runs the first time an
  instance is accessed.
- `render`: (Optional) A function that formats the current state (`ctx.memory`)
  of an instance into text (or XML) for the AI model to understand the current
  situation within that specific workspace.
- `actions`, `inputs`, `outputs`: (Optional, often added via `.setActions()`,
  etc.) Link specific tools (Actions), data sources (Inputs), and response
  methods (Outputs) directly to this context type.

## Benefit

Contexts allow your agent to manage multiple tasks or interactions
simultaneously without getting confused. Each context instance has its own
dedicated memory (`ctx.memory`) where it stores relevant information (like chat
history or task lists) persistently. The `render` function ensures the AI model
gets only the relevant state for the specific task it's working on at that
moment. Associating actions/inputs/outputs keeps your agent's capabilities
organized.

## Anticipated Questions

- _"What's the difference between context memory (`ctx.memory`) and working
  memory?"_ `ctx.memory` is the _persistent_ storage for a specific context
  instance (like chat history saved to a database). _Working memory_ is
  _temporary_ storage used during a single agent run cycle to track the steps
  (inputs, thoughts, actions) of that specific interaction.
- _"How do I identify a specific chat session if I have multiple?"_ You use the
  `schema` you define to pass identifying arguments (like a `sessionId`) when
  calling `agent.run` or `agent.send`. The optional `key` function in the
  context definition helps create truly unique IDs if needed (e.g.,
  `chat:session-xyz`).
- _"How does the AI know what happened in this specific chat?"_ The `render`
  function you define formats the relevant parts of `ctx.memory` (e.g., recent
  messages) and includes it in the prompt sent to the AI model for that specific
  context instance.
