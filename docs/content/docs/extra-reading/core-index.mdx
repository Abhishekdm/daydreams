# `index.ts`

This file serves as the main **public entry point** for the `@daydreamsai/core`
library. Think of it as the front door â€“ it doesn't contain much code itself,
but it gathers and exports all the core functions, classes, and types (like
`createDreams`, `context`, `action`, `Agent`, etc.) from other files within the
package, making them available for you to import and use in your own projects.

## How to Use

You don't interact with this file directly. When you need a core Daydreams
component, you import it directly from the package name, typically managed using
Bun in this project:
`import { createDreams, action } from '@daydreamsai/core';`. This `index.ts`
file makes that convenient import possible.

## Benefit

It defines the official public API of the `@daydreamsai/core` package and
simplifies your imports. Instead of needing to know which specific internal file
defines `createDreams` or `action`, you can access all necessary public
components from the single `@daydreamsai/core` entry point. This keeps your
import statements clean and shields your code from internal restructuring of the
library.

## Anticipated Questions

- _"Does this file contain all the code?"_ No, it mostly contains
  `export * from './[other_file]'` statements. The actual code for components
  like `createDreams`, `context`, `action`, etc., lives in other files within
  the `packages/core/src/` directory (like `dreams.ts`, `context.ts`,
  `utils.ts`). This file just makes them publicly accessible.
- _"If something isn't exported here, can I still use it?"_ Generally, no. If a
  function or type from within `packages/core/src/` is _not_ exported through
  this `index.ts` file, it's considered an internal implementation detail and
  might change without notice. You should only import components explicitly made
  available through `@daydreamsai/core`.
