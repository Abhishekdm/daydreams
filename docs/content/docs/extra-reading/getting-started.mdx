# Welcome to the "Extra Reading"

This part of the documentation started out as a collection of notes from a hobbyist developer trying to understand the `@daydreamsai/core` package more deeply. The goal isn't to be an exhaustive API reference, but rather a practical guide – "extra reading" – to help you grasp the purpose and role of the key TypeScript files that make up the core framework.

## What's Here?

Each page in this section dives into a specific Typescript file from the core library. You'll find explanations focusing on:

-   **What it is:** A high-level description of the file's purpose.
-   **How it Affects You / How to Use:** Practical information on whether you interact with it directly and how it fits into building your agent.
-   **Benefit:** Why this component exists and what advantages it offers.
-   **Anticipated Questions:** Answers to common questions a developer might have when encountering this part of the framework.

## How to Approach It

Think of these pages as supplementary material to the main concepts and tutorials. If you're wondering *why* something works the way it does in Daydreams, or what's happening under the hood when you make a call or define an action, browsing the relevant file explanations here might provide valuable context.

You can start by using the search or dive into specific files as you encounter them in your development.
