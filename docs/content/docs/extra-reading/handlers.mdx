title: handlers.ts
---

This file holds the internal "handlers" that the Daydreams agent uses during its
execution cycle (`agent.run`). When the agent receives input, or when the AI
model decides to call an action or send an output, the functions in this file
are responsible for processing those requests correctly. Think of it as the
agent's internal dispatcher and validator.

## How it Affects You

You don't call functions from this file directly. It works behind the scenes,
but it's where several important things happen based on how you defined your
actions, inputs, and outputs:

- **Validation:** When the AI model provides arguments for your `action` or
  content/attributes for your `output`, the code here validates that data
  against the `schema` you defined using Zod. If the validation fails, it
  prevents your `handler` code from running with bad data.
- **Parsing:** It parses the arguments/content provided by the AI model (which
  might be in JSON or XML format) into a usable JavaScript object/value before
  passing it to your `handler`.
- **Template Resolution:** If you use templates like `{{calls[0].someValue}}` in
  your action arguments (as described in `concepts/prompting.mdx`), the
  `resolveTemplates` function here handles resolving those values _before_ your
  action's `handler` is called.
- **Handler Execution:** It prepares the necessary context (including the
  correct memory scopes like `ctx.memory` or `ctx.actionMemory`) and then calls
  the specific `handler` function you wrote in your `action`, `input`, or
  `output` definition. For actions, it uses the `TaskRunner` to queue the
  execution.
- **Error Handling:** It defines specific errors like `NotFoundError` (if the AI
  calls a non-existent action/output) and `ParsingError` (if validation fails).

## Benefit

These handlers ensure that the interaction between the AI model's requests and
your custom code (in action/output/input handlers) is safe, validated, and
correctly contextualized. It bridges the gap between the AI's structured text
output and the execution of your JavaScript/TypeScript functions, handling
potential errors and data transformations along the way.

## Anticipated Questions

- _"Is this where my `action`'s `handler` function actually runs?"_ Yes,
  functions in this file (specifically `handleActionCall` which uses `runAction`
  from `tasks/index.ts`) are responsible for preparing the context and
  ultimately calling the `handler` you defined for your action (via the
  `TaskRunner`).
- _"What happens if the AI provides arguments that don't match my action's Zod
  schema?"_ The validation logic within `prepareActionCall` in this file will
  catch the mismatch, throw a `ParsingError`, and prevent your action's
  `handler` from being called with invalid data.
- _"How does the agent know which specific context's memory (`ctx.memory`) to
  give my action handler?"_ The logic here (within functions like
  `prepareActionCall` and `handleOutput`) identifies the correct `ContextState`
  based on the current run and makes its `memory` available in the `ctx` object
  passed to your handler.
