This file provides a convenient helper object named `http` for making network
requests to external APIs or web services from within your agent's actions. It's
essentially a smarter version of the standard web `fetch` command.

## How to Use

When you write an `action` handler that needs to fetch data from or send data to
an external API, you can import and use this `http` object.

- For simple GET requests expecting JSON data:

  ```typescript
  import { http } from "@daydreamsai/core"; // Assuming it's re-exported

  // Inside an action handler:
  try {
    const data = await http.get.json<{ someField: string }>(
      "https://api.example.com/data?id=123"
    );
    console.log(data.someField);
    return { success: true, result: data };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("API call failed:", error);
    return { success: false, error: "API failed" };
  }
  ```

- For POST requests sending JSON data:

  ```typescript
  import { http } from "@daydreamsai/core";

  // Inside an action handler:
  const payload = { name: "Widget", value: 42 };
  try {
    const response = await http.post.json(
      "https://api.example.com/create",
      payload
    );
    return { success: true, id: response.id };
  } catch (error) {
    // ... handle error ...
  }
  ```

- It also includes helpers for specific protocols like `http.jsonrpc(...)` and
  `http.graphql(...)`.

## Benefit

- **Automatic Retries:** The key benefit is built-in automatic retries. If a
  network request fails due to a temporary network issue or a specific server
  error (like 500 or 503), the `http` helper will automatically wait a bit and
  try the request again a few times before giving up. This makes your actions
  more resilient to temporary glitches.
- **Convenience:** Provides shortcuts for common tasks like setting JSON
  headers, parsing JSON responses, and adding query parameters (`params`
  option).

## Anticipated Questions

- _"Do I have to use this instead of `fetch`?"_ No, you can still use the
  standard `fetch` API directly in your actions if you prefer. However, using
  the `http` helper gives you the automatic retry logic for free.
- _"How do I set custom headers (like Authorization)?"_ You can pass standard
  `fetch` options (like `headers`) as the last argument to the `http` methods
  (e.g.,
  `http.get.json(url, params, { headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ...' } })`).
