# `jsonpath.ts` (Internal Utility)

This internal file provides a utility function, `jsonPath`, used _by the Daydreams framework itself_ to query and extract specific pieces of data from complex JSON objects. It implements the JSONPath standard, allowing for targeted data retrieval using query expressions.

## How it Works Internally

When the framework needs to pull specific data from a potentially large or nested JSON structure (perhaps from an action's configuration, an internal state object, or even potentially processing complex arguments provided by the LLM before validation), it can use this `jsonPath` function with a query string (e.g., `$.data.items[*].name`) to get just the required information without manually navigating the entire object.

## Benefit (to the Framework)

Using `jsonPath` internally simplifies the framework's own code when it needs to process complex JSON structures. It provides a standard, concise way to access nested data, making the internal handling of such data cleaner and potentially more robust than manual traversal.

## Anticipated Questions

-   _"Should I import `jsonPath` in my agent code?"_
    No, this function is not exported as part of the public `@daydreamsai/core` API. It's intended for internal use by the framework itself.
-   _"Where might the framework use this?"_
    Potentially in areas like `handlers.ts` when processing action arguments or results, or within specific extensions or services that deal with complex JSON configurations or API responses, although its exact usage points are internal implementation details.
