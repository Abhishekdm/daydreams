This file provides the `Logger` class used throughout the Daydreams framework
for recording informational messages, warnings, and errors that occur during
agent execution. It helps you understand what your agent is doing and diagnose
problems.

## How to Use

You don't typically create a `Logger` instance yourself. The agent object
returned by `createDreams` already has a pre-configured logger available at
`agent.logger`. You use this instance inside your `action` handlers, `context`
lifecycle methods, or `service` definitions to log relevant information:

```typescript
import {
  action,
  type ActionCallContext,
  type AnyAgent,
} from "@daydreamsai/core";

export const myAction = action({
  name: "processData",
  // ... schema ...
  async handler(args, ctx: ActionCallContext, agent: AnyAgent) {
    // Log informational message
    agent.logger.info("processData:handler", "Starting data processing", {
      inputArgs: args,
    });

    try {
      // ... do some work ...
      const result = { status: "completed" };
      // Log successful completion (at debug level)
      agent.logger.debug("processData:handler", "Processing successful", {
        result,
      });
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      // Log an error
      agent.logger.error("processData:handler", "Processing failed!", {
        error,
      });
      throw error; // Re-throw or handle error
    }
  },
});
```

- Common methods are `agent.logger.info()`, `agent.logger.warn()`,
  `agent.logger.error()`, `agent.logger.debug()`, and `agent.logger.trace()`.
- Each method takes a `context` string (often the function/component name), a
  `message` string, and optional `data` object.

## Benefit

Provides a standard way to record what's happening inside your agent. This is
crucial for:

- **Debugging:** Seeing the flow of execution, variable values, and errors.
- **Monitoring:** Understanding how your agent is performing in production.
- **Auditing:** Keeping a record of important events or decisions. The default
  logger prints messages to the console with timestamps, levels, and context,
  making it easy to follow along.

## Anticipated Questions

- _"How can I change the logging level (e.g., see DEBUG messages)?"_ You can set
  the `logLevel` option when calling `createDreams`. For example:
  `createDreams({ ..., logLevel: LogLevel.DEBUG })`. The levels are `ERROR`,
  `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE` (most verbose).
- _"Can I send logs somewhere other than the console?"_ Yes, the logger is
  designed with "transports". While the default is `ConsoleTransport`, you could
  potentially implement custom transports (though this is an advanced topic not
  covered here) and provide them via the `logger` or `transports` option in
  `createDreams`.
- _"Why provide a `context` string (like `'processData:handler'`)?"_ It helps
  identify _where_ in the code the log message originated, which is very useful
  for debugging complex agents.
