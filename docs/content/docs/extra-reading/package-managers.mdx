title: package managers
---

It's worth mentioning the role of a good package manager, especially for rapid
development and monorepos. Wondering which one to use? The simple answer:
**[Bun](https://bun.sh/package-manager)**

## **Why?**

For the hobbyist developer, Bun offers several compelling advantages:

- **Speed:** Bun reduces wait time for installing dependencies, running scripts,
  and starting your application/agent.

- **Simplicity:** Bun acts as a runtime, package manager, bundler, and test
  runner rolled into one. This eliminates the need to learn, configure, and
  manage multiple separate tools. Keep it clean.

- **Ease of Use:** No more needing separate compilation steps (`tsc`) before
  running your code (`node index.js`). Bun runs TypeScript directly.

Essentially, Bun lets hobbyists focus more on building cool things and less on
wrangling complex development toolchains.
