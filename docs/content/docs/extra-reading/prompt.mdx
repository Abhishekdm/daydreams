# `prompt.ts`

This file offers general tools for working with prompt templates and parsing structured (XML) responses, separate from the main agent prompt defined in `prompts/main.ts`. It provides `createPrompt` for making reusable prompt templates and `createParser` for defining how to extract data from XML text into a specific JavaScript object structure.

## How to Use

While the core agent loop uses its own specific prompt, you might use these helpers in more advanced scenarios, perhaps within an `action` handler:

-   `createPrompt`: If an action needs to call _another_ LLM for a sub-task, you could use `createPrompt` to define a reusable template for that specific sub-task prompt.

    ```typescript
    import { createPrompt } from "@daydreamsai/core";

    const summarizeTemplate = createPrompt<{ textToSummarize: string }>(
      "Please summarize the following text concisely:\n{{textToSummarize}}"
    );

    // Later, in an action handler:
    const subTaskPrompt = summarizeTemplate({ textToSummarize: someLongText });
    // const summary = await callAnotherLLM(subTaskPrompt);
    ```

-   `createParser`: If an action receives a complex XML response from an external system (or perhaps even from a specialized LLM call), you could use `createParser` to define precisely how to extract the necessary data from the XML tags into a structured JavaScript object.

## Benefit

Provides flexible utilities for developers who need to implement custom prompt generation or response parsing logic within their actions or extensions, beyond the standard agent interaction loop. `createPrompt` helps manage reusable prompt strings, and `createParser` offers a structured way to handle custom XML parsing needs.

## Anticipated Questions

-   _"Is this the main prompt the agent uses?"_
    No, the main prompt template and its formatting logic are primarily defined in `packages/core/src/prompts/main.ts`. This file (`prompt.ts`) provides more general, optional tools for custom prompt/parsing scenarios.
-   _"When would I need `createParser`?"_
    It's less common, but potentially useful if an action interacts with a system that returns data in a specific XML format, and you want a structured way to extract information based on tag names.
