title: serviceProvider.ts

This file provides the `service` helper function, which you use to define how
shared resources or external clients (like an API client, database connection,
or special utility) should be managed by the Daydreams framework. It ensures
these services are set up correctly and are ready to use when your agent needs
them.

## How to Use

You typically define a service in its own file using `service({...})` and then
include it in an `Extension`. Inside the `service({...})` call, you can define:

- `register(container)`: (Optional) A function where you tell the agent's DI
  Container (`agent.container`) how to create this service instance. Often,
  you'll use
  `container.singleton('serviceName', () => new MyServiceClient(...))` here to
  ensure only one instance is created.
- `boot(container)`: (Optional) An `async` function where you perform any
  necessary initialization _after_ all services have been registered (e.g.,
  connecting to the API using credentials maybe resolved from the container).
  This runs when `agent.start()` is called.

```typescript
import { service, type Container } from "@daydreamsai/core";

// Assume MyApiClient class exists
declare class MyApiClient {
  constructor(config: { url: string });
  connect(): Promise<void>;
}

export const myApiService = service({
  register(container: Container) {
    // Tell the container how to create the client (as a singleton)
    container.singleton(
      "myApiClient",
      () => new MyApiClient({ url: "https://api.example.com" })
    );
  },
  async boot(container: Container) {
    // Initialize the client after registration
    const client = container.resolve<MyApiClient>("myApiClient");
    await client.connect();
    console.log("My API Client connected!");
  },
});

// Typically, you would then include `myApiService` in an extension's `services` array.
```

## Benefit

Defining services this way ensures proper setup and teardown, especially for
resources needing asynchronous initialization (`boot`). It integrates smoothly
with the DI Container, making services easily accessible via
`agent.container.resolve('serviceName')` in your actions or other components,
without them needing to know the setup details. Bundling services in Extensions
makes them reusable.

## Anticipated Questions

- _"When should I use a `service` vs just putting logic in an `action`?"_ Use a
  `service` for shared, reusable components, especially those managing
  connections to external systems or requiring specific setup/initialization
  steps (`boot`). Actions are better for defining specific _tasks_ the agent can
  perform, which might _use_ one or more services obtained from the container.
- _"What's the difference between `register` and `boot`?"_ `register` runs first
  and only tells the container _how_ to create the service. `boot` runs later
  (during `agent.start()`) and performs the actual initialization (like
  connecting), potentially using other services that were registered earlier.
- _"Do I need to call `createServiceManager()`?"_ No, this is handled internally
  by `createDreams`. You just define your services using the `service` helper.
