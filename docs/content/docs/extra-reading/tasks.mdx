# `task.ts` & `tasks/index.ts`

These files define the system (`TaskRunner`) that manages how your agent runs asynchronous operations, especially the `handler` functions inside your custom `action` definitions. Think of it as a queue manager that prevents your agent from trying to do too many things at once, particularly when actions involve waiting for external APIs or services.

## How it Affects You

You don't directly use the `TaskRunner` or the `task` function yourself. However, its existence impacts how you write your `action` handlers:

-   **Concurrency:** By default, the agent only runs a few action handlers simultaneously (e.g., 3). If the AI model asks the agent to perform many actions quickly, some will wait in a queue managed by the `TaskRunner` before they start executing. This prevents overwhelming external services.
-   **Asynchronous Code:** Because actions are run through this system, your `action` handlers **must** use `async` and `await` correctly if they perform any operations that take time (like network requests `fetch`, database calls, or even just `setTimeout`). The `TaskRunner` waits for the `Promise` returned by your `async handler` to finish.
-   **Retries:** You can add a `retry` option when defining an `action`. If the action's handler fails (throws an error), the `TaskRunner` will automatically try running it again a few times. If you use this, try to make your handler logic _idempotent_ (safe to run multiple times with the same input).
-   **Cancellation:** Long-running actions should check for cancellation signals. Inside your `action` handler, the `ctx` object contains an `abortSignal`. You should check `ctx.abortSignal.aborted` periodically in long loops or before/after long waits and stop execution if it's `true`. This allows the agent's overall run to be cancelled cleanly if needed.

## Benefit

The `TaskRunner` automatically handles concurrency limits and retries for your actions, making your agent more stable and preventing it from accidentally overloading external systems you interact with. It ensures asynchronous operations are managed correctly within the agent's lifecycle.

## Anticipated Questions

-   _"Do I need to create a `TaskRunner`?"_
    No, `createDreams` creates one for you automatically with default settings.
-   _"How do I know when my action handler actually runs?"_
    It runs shortly after the AI model calls the action, but it might be delayed slightly if the `TaskRunner`'s queue is busy with other actions. Use `agent.logger` inside your handler to see when it starts and finishes.
-   _"What if my action needs to run for a very long time?"_
    Make sure to implement the cancellation check using `ctx.abortSignal.aborted` so the agent can stop it if necessary.
