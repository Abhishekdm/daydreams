This file provides essential "factory" functions that you use to define the
building blocks of your Daydreams agent, such as its tools (Actions), how it
receives information (Inputs), how it responds (Outputs), how it remembers
things specifically for an action (Memory), and how you bundle features together
(Extensions).

## How to Use

You'll import these functions directly from `@daydreamsai/core` when defining
your agent's components, typically in separate files.

- `action({...})`: Use this to define a specific capability or tool for your
  agent. You give it a `name`, `description`, expected arguments (`schema` using
  Zod), and the `handler` code that runs when the AI decides to use this tool.
  (See `concepts/actions.mdx` for details).

  ```typescript
  import { action } from "@daydreamsai/core";
  import { z } from "zod";

  export const myAction = action({
    name: "myTool",
    description: "Does something cool.",
    schema: z.object({ param: z.string() }),
    handler: async (args, ctx, agent) => {
      /* ... */
    },
  });
  ```

- `input({...})`: Use this to define how your agent receives information from
  the outside world (like a chat message or an API event). You specify how to
  `subscribe` to the source and how to `send` incoming data into the agent for
  processing. (See `concepts/inputs.mdx`).
- `output({...})`: Use this to define how your agent sends information out (like
  replying to a chat). You give it a `type`, expected content structure
  (`schema`), and the `handler` code that performs the sending. (See
  `concepts/outputs.mdx`).
- `extension({...})`: Use this to package related actions, inputs, outputs,
  contexts, and services together into a reusable module. You provide a `name`
  and arrays/objects containing the components this extension provides. (See
  `advanced/extensions.mdx`).
- `memory({...})`: A specialized helper used within an `action` definition if
  that specific action needs its own persistent memory across different calls
  (less common than context memory). You provide a `key` and a `create` function
  for its initial state.

## Benefit

These functions provide a standardized way to define the different parts of your
agent. They ensure all the necessary configuration details are provided and
integrate smoothly with the agent's lifecycle and the AI model. They abstract
away the internal wiring, letting you focus on the logic of your agent's
capabilities.

## Anticipated Questions

- _"Do I use these functions inside `createDreams`?"_ No, you typically use
  these functions in separate files to define your actions, inputs, etc., and
  then you import those definitions and pass them _to_ `createDreams` in its
  configuration object (e.g., in the `actions: [...]` or `extensions: [...]`
  arrays).
- _"What's the difference between `action` and `output`?"_ Use `action` when the
  agent needs to perform a task and get a result back to continue thinking (like
  looking up information). Use `output` when the agent just needs to send
  information out (like sending a final reply message).
