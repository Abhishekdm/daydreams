title: Extensions
---

Extensions are pre-packaged bundles of inputs, outputs, and actions that add
specific capabilities to your agent. For example, the `cli` extension adds
terminal input/output capabilities.

## Using Extensions

Extensions are added to an agent using the `extensions` option in the
`createDreams` function.

```ts
import { createDreams } from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { cli } from "@daydreamsai/core/extensions";

const agent = createDreams({
  extensions: [cli],
});
```
