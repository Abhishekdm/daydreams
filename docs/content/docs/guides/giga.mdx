This guide will walk you through creating an AI agent that can play the
Gigaverse dungeon crawler game using Daydreams.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

1. A Gigaverse account
2. The following environment variables set up:
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key
   - `GIGA_TOKEN`: Your Gigaverse authentication token (Bearer token from
     browser)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

## Creating the Agent

First, let's create a basic Gigaverse agent:

```ts
import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";
import {
  createDreams,
  context,
  render,
  action,
  validateEnv,
  LogLevel,
  type ActionCall,
  type Agent,
} from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { cli } from "@daydreamsai/core/extensions";
import { z } from "zod";

// Validate environment variables
const env = validateEnv(
  z.object({
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: z.string().min(1, "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is required"),
    GIGA_TOKEN: z.string().min(1, "GIGA_TOKEN is required"),
    OPENAI_API_KEY: z.string().min(1, "OPENAI_API_KEY is required"),
  })
);

// Define the goal-oriented context
const goalContexts = context({
  type: "goal",
  schema: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    initialGoal: z.string(),
    initialTasks: z.array(z.string()),
  }),

  key({ id }) {
    return id;
  },

  create(state) {
    return {
      goal: state.args.initialGoal,
      tasks: state.args.initialTasks ?? [],
      currentTask: state.args.initialTasks?.[0],
    };
  },

  render({ memory }) {
    return render(template, {
      goal: memory.goal,
      tasks: memory.tasks.join("\n"),
      currentTask: memory.currentTask ?? "NONE",
    });
  },
});

// Create the Gigaverse agent
const agent = createDreams({
  logger: LogLevel.INFO,
  model: anthropic("claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"),
  extensions: [cli],
  context: goalContexts,
  actions: [
    // Actions will be defined below
  ],
});

// Start the agent
await agent.start({
  id: "gigaverse-agent",
  initialGoal: "Successfully complete a dungeon run in Gigaverse",
  initialTasks: [
    "Start a new dungeon run",
    "Make strategic combat decisions using rock-paper-scissors mechanics",
    "Select optimal loot after defeating enemies",
    "Progress as far as possible in the dungeon",
  ],
});
```

## How It Works

The Gigaverse agent is built using several key components:

1. **Context Template**: Defines the agent's understanding of the game and its
   current state:

```ts
const template = `
# Gigaverse Dungeon Game

You are an AI agent playing a rock-paper-scissors dungeon crawler game.

## Game Rules:
- Combat is resolved through rock-paper-scissors mechanics
- You can collect loot after defeating enemies
- Your goal is to progress as far as possible in the dungeon

## Current Status:
Goal: {{goal}} 
Tasks: {{tasks}}
Current Task: {{currentTask}}

Make strategic decisions based on enemy patterns and your current state.
`;
```

2. **Game Actions**: The agent can perform several actions in the game:

   - `attackInDungeon`: Make combat decisions (rock, paper, scissors) or select
     loot
   - `getPlayerState`: Retrieve the current game state
   - `startNewRun`: Begin a new dungeon run

## Understanding Gigaverse Game Mechanics

Gigaverse is a dungeon crawler game with the following key mechanics:

1. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Combat**: Battles are resolved using the classic
   rock-paper-scissors game:

   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock

2. **Dungeon Progression**: Players advance through the dungeon by defeating
   enemies.

3. **Loot System**: After defeating enemies, players can select one of three
   loot options to enhance their character.

4. **Health Management**: Players must manage their health throughout the
   dungeon run.

## Core Game Actions

Let's implement the three main actions needed for the Gigaverse agent:

### 1. Attack in Dungeon

This action handles both combat (rock-paper-scissors) and loot selection:

```ts
action({
  name: "attackInDungeon",
  description: "Attack in the dungeon using rock-paper-scissors game mechanics",
  schema: z.object({
    action: z.enum([
      "rock",
      "paper",
      "scissor",
      "loot_one",
      "loot_two",
      "loot_three",
    ]).describe("The attack move to make"),
    dungeonId: z.number().default(0).describe("The ID of the dungeon"),
  }),
  async handler(call, ctx, agent) {
    try {
      const { action, dungeonId } = call.data;

      const response = await fetch(
        "https://gigaverse.io/api/game/dungeon/action",
        {
          method: "POST",
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            Authorization: `Bearer ${env.GIGA_TOKEN}`,
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            action: action,
            actionToken: new Date().getTime().toString(),
            dungeonId: dungeonId,
          }),
        }
      );

      const result = await response.json();
      return {
        success: true,
        result: result,
        message: `Successfully performed ${action} in dungeon ${dungeonId}`,
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
        message: "Attack action failed",
      };
    }
  },
}),
```

### 2. Get Player State

This action retrieves the current state of the player in the dungeon:

```ts
action({
  name: "getPlayerState",
  description: "Get the current state of the player in the dungeon",
  schema: z.object({}),
  async handler(call, ctx, agent) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        "https://gigaverse.io/api/game/dungeon/state",
        {
          method: "GET",
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            Authorization: `Bearer ${env.GIGA_TOKEN}`,
          },
        }
      );

      const result = await response.json();
      return {
        success: true,
        playerState: result,
        message: "Successfully fetched player's dungeon state",
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
        message: "Failed to fetch player's dungeon state",
      };
    }
  },
}),
```

### 3. Start New Run

This action initiates a new dungeon run:

```ts
action({
  name: "startNewRun",
  description: "Start a new dungeon run. Use this when the player dies or wants to start a new run from outside the dungeon.",
  schema: z.object({
    dungeonId: z.number().default(1).describe("The ID of the dungeon to start. Default is 1."),
  }),
  async handler(call, ctx, agent) {
    try {
      const { dungeonId } = call.data;

      const response = await fetch(
        "https://gigaverse.io/api/game/dungeon/action",
        {
          method: "POST",
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            Authorization: `Bearer ${env.GIGA_TOKEN}`,
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            action: "start_run",
            actionToken: new Date().getTime().toString(),
            dungeonId: dungeonId,
          }),
        }
      );

      const result = await response.json();
      return {
        success: true,
        result: result,
        message: `Successfully started new run in dungeon ${dungeonId}`,
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
        message: "Failed to start new dungeon run",
      };
    }
  },
}),
```

## Agent Decision Making

The agent uses the context and player state to make strategic decisions. Here's
how the agent approaches the game:

1. **Analyzing Enemy Patterns**:

   - The agent observes patterns in enemy moves over multiple encounters
   - It can identify if an enemy favors certain moves (like using "rock" more
     frequently)
   - This information helps the agent make counter-moves (like choosing "paper"
     against a "rock"-favoring enemy)

2. **Loot Selection Strategy**:

   - After defeating enemies, the agent evaluates the three loot options
   - It considers the player's current health, inventory, and progression
   - The agent selects loot that complements the player's build or addresses
     weaknesses

3. **Adaptive Gameplay**:

   - As the dungeon difficulty increases, the agent adjusts its strategy
   - It may prioritize health-restoring items when health is low
   - The agent can become more conservative or aggressive based on the player's
     current state

4. **Goal-Oriented Planning**:
   - The agent maintains awareness of its overall goal and current tasks
   - It can reprioritize tasks based on the changing game state
   - This ensures the agent makes decisions that contribute to long-term success

## Integrating with Daydreams

This example showcases several key Daydreams features:

1. **Goal-Oriented Context**: The agent maintains a structured goal and task
   list.

2. **Action Definitions**: Clear, typed actions with Zod schemas for validation.

3. **API Integration**: Seamless interaction with external APIs (Gigaverse in
   this case).

4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to manage API failures gracefully.

## Next Steps

- Customize the agent's strategy by modifying the context template
- Add more sophisticated decision-making logic
- Implement inventory management and character progression
- Extend the agent to handle more complex game scenarios
