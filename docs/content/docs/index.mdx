## Overview

Daydreams is a framework for building autonomous AI agents. At its core, an
agent analyzes incoming information (inputs), reasons about it using a Large
Language Model (LLM), and decides on the next steps, which could be generating a
response (output) or performing a task (action). The results of actions feed
back into the agent's awareness, creating a continuous loop orchestrated by the
LLM.

This allows you to build agents that can interact with various systems like
blockchains, social media, APIs, and more, based on goals and context.

agent!**

## Installation

You can install the core Daydreams package and the CLI helper using npm or bun:

```bash
npm install @daydreamsai/core @daydreamsai/cli
# or
bun add @daydreamsai/core @daydreamsai/cli
```

You will also need an LLM provider SDK, for example, OpenAI:

```bash
npm install @ai-sdk/openai
# or
bun add @ai-sdk/openai
```

Make sure you have an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set.

## Core Concepts

Daydreams is built around a few key ideas:

- **[Agent Lifecycle](/docs/concepts/agent-lifecycle):** The central
  orchestrator that runs the main loop.
- **[Contexts](/docs/concepts/contexts):** Manages the state and memory for a
  specific task or interaction (e.g., a chat session).
- **[Inputs](/docs/concepts/inputs):** How agents receive information (e.g., CLI
  messages, API events).
- **[Outputs](/docs/concepts/outputs):** How agents respond or send information
  out (e.g., CLI responses, tweets).
- **[Actions](/docs/concepts/actions):** Tasks agents can perform (e.g., calling
  an API, executing a transaction).
- **[Memory](/docs/concepts/memory):** How agents store and recall information
  (working memory, episodic memory).

Dive deeper into these in the [Core Concepts](/docs/concepts/core) section.

## Your First Agent (CLI Echo Bot)

Let's create a simple agent that echoes back whatever you type in the command
line.

**1. Set up your project:**

```bash
mkdir my-first-agent
cd my-first-agent
npm init -y
npm install @daydreamsai/core @daydreamsai/cli @ai-sdk/openai zod
# or use bun
# bun init
# bun add @daydreamsai/core @daydreamsai/cli @ai-sdk/openai zod
```

**2. Create `agent.ts`:**

```typescript
import { createDreams, context, input, output } from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { cliExtension } from "@daydreamsai/cli";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { z } from "zod";

// 1. Define the main context for our agent
const echoContext = context({
  type: "echo",
  // No specific args needed for this simple context
  schema: z.object({}),
  // Instructions for the LLM
  instructions:
    "You are a simple echo bot. Repeat the user's message back to them.",
});

// 2. Create the agent instance
const agent = createDreams({
  // Use the OpenAI model
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  // Include the CLI extension for input/output
  extensions: [cliExtension],
  // Register our custom context
  contexts: [echoContext],
});

// 3. Start the agent and run the context
async function main() {
  // Start the agent (initializes services like readline)
  await agent.start();

  console.log("Echo agent started. Type 'exit' to quit.");

  // Run our echo context. Since it uses the cliExtension,
  // it will automatically start listening for console input.
  // We use {} for args because our context schema is an empty object.
  await agent.run({
    context: echoContext,
    args: {},
  });

  // Agent stops when the input loop (in cliExtension) breaks (e.g., on "exit")
  console.log("Agent stopped.");
}

main();
```

**3. Run the agent:**

Make sure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set.

```bash
node agent.ts
```

Now you can type messages, and the agent should echo them back using the CLI
input and output handlers provided by `cliExtension`.
