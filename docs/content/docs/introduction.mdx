## Architecture

Daydreams is a powerful yet simple system where agents process input streams
into actions. The actions' results feed back as new inputs, creating a
continuous loop of processing and execution - all orchestrated automatically by
the LLM's reasoning capabilities.

The framework consists of several key components:

1. **Dreams Engine** - The core orchestration layer that manages:

   - Input/Output streams
   - Context management
   - Memory systems
   - Action execution
   - Service providers

2. **Context System** - Maintains state and working memory for each agent
   instance

3. **Memory System** - Flexible storage for:

   - Vector embeddings
   - Episodic memory
   - Working memory
   - Long-term storage

4. **Action System** - Executes agent decisions through:
   - Built-in actions
   - Custom action handlers
   - Chain-specific actions
   - Extension actions

## Features

### 🔌 Comprehensive LLM Provider Support

Seamlessly integrate with any LLM provider through the AI SDK. Switch between
providers or use multiple providers simultaneously for different tasks.

#### Supported Providers:

**Cloud Providers:**

- **OpenAI** - State-of-the-art language models for general and specialized
  tasks
- **Anthropic** - Advanced language models focused on safety and reliability
- **Google** - Powerful models with multimodal capabilities
- **Groq** - High-performance inference platform
- **Azure OpenAI** - Enterprise-grade AI deployment
- **Cohere** - Specialized models for business applications
- **AI21 Labs** - Advanced language understanding models

**Local & Self-hosted:**

- **Ollama** - Easy-to-use local model deployment
- **Local Inference**
  - GGUF model support
  - Transformers integration
  - Custom model deployment
  - HuggingFace models

Example Configuration:

```ts
const dreams = createDreams({
  // Use a single provider
  model: groq(),

  // Or mix providers for different tasks
  reasoningModel: anthropic(),
  experts: {
    coder: openai(),
    planner: anthropic(),
  },
});
```

### 🎮 Simple IO Interface

A straightforward and intuitive input/output interface that makes it easy to
build and control your agents without complex setup.

```ts
// Define inputs your agent can process
const inputs = {
  onChainEvent: {
    schema: z.object({
      type: z.string(),
      data: z.any(),
    }),
    handler: async (data, context, agent) => {
      // Process blockchain events
    },
  },
};

// Define outputs your agent can produce
const outputs = {
  tweet: {
    schema: z.object({
      content: z.string(),
    }),
    handler: async (data, context, agent) => {
      // Post to Twitter
    },
  },
};
```

### 💉 Dynamic Context Injection

Inject context and information dynamically into your agent's reasoning process,
allowing for real-time adaptation and response to changing conditions.

```ts
// Create a context with dynamic state
const tradingContext = {
  type: "trading",
  schema: z.object({
    pair: z.string(),
    strategy: z.string(),
  }),
  // Inject market data
  onStep: async (context, agent) => {
    const marketData = await getMarketData(context.args.pair);
    context.workingMemory.marketData = marketData;
  },
};
```

### 💾 Memory Adaptors

Bring your own memory solution or use our built-in adaptors. Flexible memory
management lets you choose how your agents store and retrieve information.

**Built-in Adaptors:**

- In-memory vector store
- SQLite persistence
- Redis cache
- Postgres vector store
- Pinecone vector DB
- Custom storage implementations

```ts
const dreams = createDreams({
  memory: createMemory(
    // Document store
    createPostgresStore(),
    // Vector store
    createPineconeStore()
  ),
});
```

### 🧩 Extensions

Easily extend your agent's capabilities with drop-in clients for various
platforms and protocols:

**Social Media:**

- Twitter/X integration
- Telegram bot support
- Discord bot framework
- Farcaster protocol

**Development:**

- GitHub integration

  - All major L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)
- Solana
  - Mainnet
  - Testnet clusters
- Polygon
  - PoS chain
  - zkEVM
- Alternative L1s
  - Avalanche
  - BSC
  - Cosmos
  - Near

Features:

### 🎯 Goal-Oriented Behavior

Long-term planning and goal-oriented behavior capabilities for complex task
execution:

- Hierarchical goal decomposition
- Priority-based task scheduling
- Progress monitoring
- Failure recovery
- Dynamic replanning
- Resource optimization

### 🤔 Advanced Reasoning

Multi-step reasoning using Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN) for sophisticated
decision-making:

- Task decomposition
- Plan generation
- Constraint satisfaction
- Backtracking
- Plan repair
- Learning from experience

The framework uses HTN planning to break down complex goals into achievable
sub-tasks, allowing agents to:

- Handle complex, multi-step tasks
- Adapt to changing conditions
- Learn from past experiences
- Optimize resource usage
- Maintain goal consistency
