title: MCP Extension
description:
  Use the Daydreams MCP extension to connect agents to external tools and data
  sources via MCP servers.
---

The `@daydreamsai/mcp` extension connects a Daydreams agent to external servers
that follow the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows an agent to discover
and use tools provided by those servers, such as web scraping, 3D rendering, or
accessing a filesystem.

_The agent interacts with these external tools as if they were native actions._

### Installation

Install the necessary packages into your project:

```bash
pnpm add @daydreamsai/core @daydreamsai/mcp
```

### Configuration

To connect an agent to an MCP server, you use the `createMcpExtension` in the
agent's `extensions` array. This function takes an array of server
configurations, allowing the agent to connect to one or multiple servers at
once.

### Transport Options

The `transport` object within a server's configuration specifies how the agent
connects to it.

- **`stdio`**: For servers that run as a local child process. The agent
  communicates with the server over its standard input and output streams.

  ```ts
  {
    type: "stdio",
    command: "npx",
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/allowed/path"],
  }
  ```

- **`sse`**: For remote servers that support Server-Sent Events over HTTP.
  ```ts
  {
    type: "sse",
    serverUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
    sseEndpoint: "/events",
    messageEndpoint: "/messages",
  }
  ```
