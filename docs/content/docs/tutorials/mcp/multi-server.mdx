title: Multiple Servers
description:
  Configure a Daydreams agent to connect to and use tools from multiple Model
  Context Protocol (MCP) servers simultaneously.

This tutorial shows how to configure an agent to connect to two separate MCP
servers: one for web scraping (`firecrawl-mcp`) and another for 3D rendering
(`blender-mcp`).

### Configuration

The agent is configured by passing an array of server configurations to
`createMcpExtension`. Each server has a unique `id` which is used to direct tool
calls to the correct server.

```typescript title="multi-mcp-agent.ts"
import { createDreams, Logger, LogLevel } from "@daydreamsai/core";
import { createMcpExtension } from "@daydreamsai/mcp";
import { cliExtension } from "@daydreamsai/cli";
import { openrouter } from "@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider";

createDreams({
  model: openrouter("google/gemini-2.0-flash-001"),
  logger: new Logger({
    level: LogLevel.INFO,
  }),
  extensions: [
    cliExtension,
    createMcpExtension([
      {
        id: "firecrawl-mcp",
        name: "Firecrawl MCP Server",
        transport: {
          type: "stdio",
          command: "npx",
          args: ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
        },
      },
      {
        id: "blender-mcp",
        name: "Blender MCP Server",
        transport: {
          type: "stdio",
          command: "uvx",
          args: ["blender-mcp"],
        },
      },
    ]),
  ],
}).start();
```

### Key Concepts

- The `createMcpExtension` function takes an array of server configuration
  objects.
- Each server requires a unique `id` which the agent uses to target tool calls
  (e.g., `firecrawl-mcp`).
- The `transport` object defines the connection method. For local executables,
  `stdio` is used with a `command` and an `args` array.

### Agent Operation

Once running, the agent can access tools from both servers. It uses the
`mcp.callTool` action and specifies the target server with the `serverId`
parameter.

To use a tool from the Firecrawl server:

```typescript
// Internal agent action call
agent.actions.mcp.callTool({
  serverId: "firecrawl-mcp",
  name: "scrape_url",
  arguments: { url: "..." },
});
```

To use a tool from the Blender server:

```typescript
// Internal agent action call
agent.actions.mcp.callTool({
  serverId: "blender-mcp",
  name: "render_scene",
  arguments: { "..." }
});
```

The agent learns which tools are available on each server by calling the
`mcp.listTools` action for each `serverId` after it starts.
