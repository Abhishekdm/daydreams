  This guide will walk you through creating an AI agent that can interact with
  Discord using DreamsAI.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

1. A Discord bot application set up in the Discord Developer Portal
2. The following environment variables set up:
   - `GROQ_API_KEY`: Your Groq API key
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token

## Getting Your Discord Token

To get your Discord bot token, follow these steps:

1. **Go to the Discord Developer Portal**

   - Visit
     [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Log in with your Discord account

2. **Create a New Application**

   - Click "New Application"
   - Give your bot a name and click "Create"

3. **Navigate to the Bot Section**

   - In the left sidebar, click "Bot"
   - Click "Add Bot" if prompted

4. **Get Your Token**

   - Under the "Token" section, click "Reset Token"
   - Copy the token that appears (keep this secret!)
   - Add this token to your `.env` file as `DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here`

5. **Set Bot Permissions**

   - Scroll down to "Bot Permissions"
   - Select the permissions your bot needs (at minimum: "Send Messages", "Read
     Message History")

6. **Invite Your Bot to a Server**
   - Go to the "OAuth2" > "URL Generator" section
   - Select "bot" scope and the permissions you need
   - Use the generated URL to invite your bot to a Discord server

## Creating the Agent

First, let's create a basic Discord agent:

```ts title="agent.ts"
import { createGroq } from "@ai-sdk/groq";
import {
  createContainer,
  createDreams,
  LogLevel,
  discord,
} from "@daydreamsai/core";

// Initialize Groq client
const groq = createGroq({
  apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY!,
});

// Create the agent
const agent = createDreams({
  logger: LogLevel.DEBUG,
  container: createContainer(),
  model: groq("deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"),
  extensions: [discord],
});

// Start the agent
await agent.start();
```

## How It Works

The Discord agent is created using a few key components:

1. **Groq Integration**: We use Groq's language model for processing and
   understanding Discord interactions.

2. **Logger**: Set to DEBUG level for detailed logging during development.

3. **Container**: Manages dependencies and services.

4. **Discord Extension**: The `discord` extension provides built-in capabilities
   for:
   - Listening to messages in channels
   - Responding to direct messages
   - Reacting to messages
   - Managing Discord server interactions

## Next Steps

- Set up Discord bot authentication in your environment variables
- Customize the agent's behavior by adding your own extensions
- Implement specific use cases like auto-replies or server moderation
